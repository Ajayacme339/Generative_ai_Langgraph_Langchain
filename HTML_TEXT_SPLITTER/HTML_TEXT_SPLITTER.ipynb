In 1944 he was called up to man the defences on the\\nwestern front. A little over a year later he was shaken to his core by\\nwhat he learnt of the Nazi atrocities from the Nuremberg Trials, and\\nnews coverage of the Holocaust. Thus, although still in his teens, he\\nexperienced 1945 as a turning point that would shape his political and\\ncultural outlook. As he put it frankly in an interview in 1979:  \\nI am myself a product of “reeducation” … By this I\\nmean that … we learnt that the bourgeois constitutional state\\nin its French, or American, or English form is an historical\\nachievement. (1992a: interview 3, 79)  \\nTwo moments exemplify Habermas’s complex position in-between the\\ngenerations of 1945 and 1968. In 1953, when Habermas was a student at\\nGöttingen University, he published a critical essay in the concerning Heidegger’s\\nremark about “the inner truth and greatness of the Nazi\\nmovement” that Heidegger had written in his lectures on\\nmetaphysics in 1935, and then failed to retract or alter in 1953 when\\nrepublishing those lectures. (1971c [1977]) In 1968, at the height of\\nthe student protests in Germany, Habermas, who had been critical of\\nthe policing that had resulted in the killing of Benno Ohnesorg at a\\nstudent demonstration the year before, directly criticized the\\nstudents for acting out revolutionary fantasies, and for provoking the\\nauthorities into violence. He used the phrase “left-wing\\nfascism”, a term he later admitted was too harsh\\n(Müller-Doohm 2016: 141). Instead, he urged them to put the\\nlatitude granted to them by liberal democratic institutions to work in\\nthe service of a “radical reformism” (Specter 2010:\\n111–115).  \\nFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  \\nHabermas studied German philosophy and literature at Bonn, and wrote\\nhis doctoral dissertation on “The Absolute and History: the\\nAmbivalence of Schelling’s Thought”. He came to Frankfurt\\nin 1956, where he was Theodor Adorno’s at the\\nInstitute for Social Research for three years. In 1959 he left for\\nMarburg, having effectively been shouldered out by Max Horkheimer, who\\nconsidered him a dangerous Marxist, and who tried to have him\\ndismissed (Müller-Doohm 2016: 84–86; Habermas 1992a:\\ninterview 8, 218). In Marburg, he wrote his habilitation dissertation, , under\\nWolfgang Abendroth, one of the few Marxist academic philosophers in\\nthe post-war Federal Republic. Habermas, though often deemed a member\\nof the Frankfurt School, was, in reality, at the institute for a very\\nbrief period. Whilst there, he recalls, “Critical Theory, at\\nFrankfurt School—there was no such thing … no coherent\\ndoctrine” (Habermas 1992a: interview 4, 98). So it is misleading\\nto say that he was or became a “member” of the Frankfurt\\nSchool. In truth, he arrived there as an outsider, and while there,\\nbriefly, ploughed his own furrow.  \\nAssistent  \\nThe Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere  \\nHabermas returned to Frankfurt, after a short period at the University\\nof Heidelberg, where he succeeded Horkheimer, with whom he soon\\nreconciled, as Professor of Philosophy and Sociology. He declined to\\nbecome director of the institute. In Frankfurt, Habermas spent the\\nlatter half of the 1960s teaching in febrile and tumultuous political\\ncircumstances not conducive to research. In 1971 he became director of\\nthe Max Planck Institute for the Study of Living Conditions in the\\nScientific and Technical World in Starnberg, Bavaria, where he\\nconducted the research which led to his magnum opus, the two-volume . The year his magnum opus was\\npublished, 1981, Habermas resigned from the Max Planck Institute under\\nunhappy circumstances, and again returned to Frankfurt. There he would\\nremain, but for various visiting professorships in the US, until his\\nretirement in 1994. Landmark publications during these years include\\nmany essays on moral philosophy, and in 1992, Habermas’s major work in political and legal\\nphilosophy. Throughout his life Habermas has enthusiastically played\\nthe role of the public intellectual, taking part in disputes about\\npositivism in the social sciences, the historical uniqueness of the\\nHolocaust, German reunification, genetic engineering, and secularism\\nand religion. He is the recipient of numerous honorary doctorates and\\nprizes, including the Adorno Prize of the city of Frankfurt and the\\nKyoto Prize of the Inamori Foundation (Müller-Doohm 2016:\\n340).  \\nTheory of Communicative Action  \\nBetween Facts and Norms'), Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Jürgen Habermas', 'Header 2': '1.

Belonging to neither the state,\\nthe economy, nor the family, the public sphere is where private\\nindividuals come together to communicate about matters of general\\nconcern. It is the location of the public use of reason and the place\\nwhere “public opinion” is formed. is a reconstructed history of the rise and fall of\\nthe public sphere focused on Britain, France, and Germany from the\\nearly modern era to the mid-twentieth century. In the Middle Ages,\\nthere was a merely “representative” public sphere, in\\nwhich kings and nobles displayed their status before society (1962\\n[1989: 7–10]). The bourgeois public sphere begins to emerge in\\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, at first in the guise of a\\nliterary public sphere. In coffee houses, salons, and literary\\nsocieties, the new reading public came together to discuss\\nnovels—Habermas cites Samuel Richardson’s as an example (1962 [1989: 31–6, 49–50, 174]). Skills of\\ncritical reasoning first developed in the journals of the literary\\npublic sphere were subsequently applied to the political public\\nsphere, where public affairs rather than literary texts are the\\nobjects of criticism. In this period the modern state was emerging, as\\npolitical authority was gradually depersonalized and vested in\\nmore-or-less independent bureaucratic institutions, rather than the\\nperson of the monarch (1962 [1989: 17–8]). Simultaneously, the\\ndevelopment of mercantile capitalism endowed merchants with\\nunprecedented wealth and influence, and an ever-greater need for\\naccurate information about market conditions. This need was met by\\nnews-sheets and gazettes, which soon turned their attention to state\\npolicy as much as commodity prices (1962 [1989: 20–2]). The\\nbourgeois public sphere thus developed concomitantly with both the\\ncapitalist economy and the Westphalian sovereign state, and flourished\\nduring the high point of bourgeois-liberal politics in the eighteenth\\nand nineteenth centuries.  \\nThe\\nStructural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a\\nCategory of Bourgeois Society  \\nStructural\\nTransformation  \\nPamela  \\nThe bourgeois public sphere is constituted by an ideological\\nseparation between public and private. The state and politics are\\ndeemed “public”, whereas civil society, the market\\neconomy, and the family are deemed “private”. The public\\nsphere, according to Habermas, mediates between these two realms (1962\\n[1989: 30]). Participants in the bourgeois public sphere are individuals, coming together to rationally and\\ncritically discuss affairs, above all the actions of\\ngovernments; it is  \\nprivate  \\npublic  \\na realm of private individuals assembled into a public body who as\\ncitizens transmit the needs of bourgeois society to the state, in\\norder, ideally, to transform political into “rational”\\nauthority within the medium of this public sphere. (1964 [1974:\\n53])  \\nHabermas would later refer to this as the generation of\\n“communicative power”, which can legitimate the political\\nsystem’s actions if yoked to the latter’s\\n“administrative power” (1992b [1996b: 147–50]). As\\nmembers of the public, private individuals bring decisions into the\\npublic sphere where they are open to rational discussion and\\ncriticism. In the process, participants form and articulate the\\ngeneral interest of society, drawing on ideas of truth, justice and\\nhuman rights.  \\nNeedless to say, participants in the bourgeois public sphere were almost all educated male property-owning members of\\nthe bourgeoisie, along with some sympathisers from the aristocracy.\\nHabermas has acknowledged the selective membership of the bourgeois\\npublic sphere during its heyday (1992c: 425–430), although\\ncritics have charged that he does not pay sufficient attention to the\\nway it was by excluding propertyless workers\\n(Negt & Kluge 1972 [2016]) and, above all, women (Landes 1988).\\nDespite its limitations, Habermas argues that the bourgeois public\\nsphere nevertheless embodied certain principles and ideals, never\\nfully realized, that are vital to any flourishing democratic society.\\nIt was thus both an “ideal” and an “ideology”\\n(1962 [1989: 112]). Since differences in social status between\\ninterlocutors were bracketed as “private” matters (1962\\n[1989: 36]) the public sphere was in theory universal, open to any\\nliterate person (1962 [1989: 37]). This ensured that rational\\nargumentation was calibrated to universal standards of validity, not\\nto the relative status of interlocutors, and could function as a\\ncooperative search for truth and justice (1962 [1989: 54]).  \\nde facto  \\nconstituted  \\nHabermas’s approach in this early work can be described as one\\nof historical reconstruction in the service of internal criticism. He\\nreconstructs an “ideal type” of the bourgeois public\\nsphere, in order to criticize the really existing public spheres of\\nmodern democracies.  \\nThe structural transformation which marks the beginning of the end of\\nthe bourgeois public sphere involves a re-definition of the\\npublic/private distinction. Under conditions of mid-twentieth century\\n“welfare-state mass democracy”, (1962 [1989: 208]) state\\nand society became ever more entangled as governments pursued\\ninterventionist economic policies and expanded welfare provision. At\\nthe same time, non-state actors such as pressure groups, corporations,\\nand political parties played an increasing role in governance (1962\\n[1989: 142]). Habermas refers to this process as\\n“refeudalization” (1962 [1989: 200–1]).  \\nHabermas sees the modern public sphere as, in many ways, the victim of\\nits own success. As it expanded far beyond its original basis of\\neducated male property-owners, material inequalities could no longer\\nbe set aside, but rather became the subject of public debate (1962\\n[1989: 127]). And this debate was no longer a matter of\\nrational-critical analysis of state action by the assembled public,\\nbut of negotiation between interest groups which bypass public reason.\\nInstead of the approximation of society to the ideal type, what\\nemerged was an impoverished pseudo-public sphere, lacking its original\\ncapacity for rational-critical discourse, easily manipulated by\\nstates, corporations, and interest groups using the techniques of\\n“public relations” (1962 [1989: 176, 236]). Its role now,\\nas in the feudal era, is to acclaim decisions which have already been\\nmade.  \\nHabermas continues to make use of the concept of the public sphere in\\nhis later works (1973a [1975: 37–8, 48]; 1992b [1996b]),\\ndeveloping a detailed account of its place in modern societies (1992b\\n[1996b: 359–87]; 2008b [2009: chapters 8 & 9]). In his\\noriginal formulation, there was a tendency to assume the existence of\\na single unified public sphere for a single polity. In response to\\nNancy Fraser’s discussion of “subaltern\\ncounterpublics” (Fraser 1992) and acknowledging his own earlier\\nneglect of “plebian public spheres”, Habermas now concedes\\nthat there may be a multitude of intersecting public spheres within a\\ngiven society, focusing on different communities and topics but with\\nporous boundaries that allow flows of communication to pass between\\nthem (1992c: 424–5; 1992b [1996b: 373–4]). The closest\\nthing to a “universal” public sphere is the political\\npublic sphere, focused on the political system. The political public\\nsphere acts as a “sounding board” for problems which\\naffect society as a whole, as well as a “filter-bed”,\\nfiltering out contributions to public discourse which represent\\ngeneralizable interests (2008b chapter 11 [2009: chapter 9, 143]). In\\nthis manner, reflexive public opinion is formed and communicative\\npower is generated. One of the most salient features of the\\ncontemporary political public is its division into\\n“formal” and “informal” segments, the former\\ndenoting the highly regulated discourse of elected politicians,\\njudges, parliaments, and courts, and the latter the\\n“wild”, unregulated flows of communication outside these\\nspaces (2008b chapter 11 [2009: chapter 9, 159–62]). Habermas\\nargues that the right kind of feedback between formal and informal\\npublic spheres is vital for legitimating the political system’s\\nactions. At the same time, there is no reason to think that public\\nspheres must stop at national borders. In an increasingly\\ninterdependent world, global attention can be focused on single\\nissues—Habermas mentions the wars in Vietnam and Iraq as\\nexamples—creating, at least temporarily, a transnational public\\nsphere (2004: chapter 3 [2006c: 39–48]). The political\\nlegitimacy of transnational polities like the EU hinges on whether the\\npublic spheres of its member states can act together, functioning as a\\nEuropean public sphere (2008b chapter 9, chapter 11 [2009: chapter 6,\\n87–8, chapter 9, 181–3]).'), Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Jürgen Habermas', 'Header 2': '1.

The history Habermas\\nreconstructs is a decline and fall of self-reflection in —science in the broadest sense. His\\nparticular interest is in , namely the\\ntradition of critical philosophy from Kant, German Idealism, and Hegel\\nthrough to Marx, which, on his account, is gradually side-lined by\\nways of thinking that employ the methods of positivistic natural and\\nsocial science. His thesis is: “That we disavow reflection is\\npositivism” (1968b: 9 [1971a: vii]).  \\nKnowledge and Human Interests  \\nWissenschaft  \\nErkenntniskritik  \\nHabermas’s analysis takes its cue from Lukács’ idea\\nof reification—the idea that beings, forms of life, and social\\nrelations assume the appearance of nature (Lukács 1971:\\n83–223). Habermas’s analysis reveals this illusory\\nindependence and naturalness to be historical, and in principle\\nreversible. Horkheimer and Adorno’s thesis that: “All\\nreification is a forgetting” also animates the analysis\\n(Horkheimer & Adorno 1971 [2002: 191]). Positivism in the\\nempirical and social sciences, and historicism in the cultural\\nsciences, Habermas argues, exhibit a merely contemplative stance\\ntoward their respective objects, an attitude that obscures the point\\nthat science and knowledge is fundamentally a human enterprise that\\nserves human interests, which are rooted in the natural history of the\\nspecies (1968b [1971a: 301–4]).  \\nAccording to Habermas, there are three knowledge-constitutive\\ninterests. The empirical and natural sciences are governed by the\\ncognitive interest in the technical control of objectified processes.\\nThe historical-hermeneutical sciences are shaped by a practical\\ninterest in orienting action and reaching understanding, while\\nself-reflection (and ) are determined by a\\ncognitive interest in emancipation and in —autonomy and responsibility (1968b\\n[1971a: 313–314]). Habermas’s overall aim is to explain\\nhow Marxism, and social theory more broadly, succumbed to a\\npositivistic self-misconception, while rescuing the animus of\\nMarx’s theory of society for critical social theory, by\\nconnecting it with the interest in emancipation and autonomy, and with\\na method of critical self-reflection.  \\nErkenntniskritik  \\nMündigkeit  \\nHabermas’s long essay “Technology and Science as\\n‘Ideology’” is a festschrift for Herbert Marcuse,\\nand not an uncritical one (1968a [1970]). It deals with topics he\\nbroached in the volume of essays (1971\\n[1973b]) that broadly argue against the reduction of political theory\\nfrom a body of thought answering practical questions of how one should\\nlive, to “a form of social engineering that dispenses with\\npublic discourse” (Celikates & Jaeggi 2009 [2017: 261]).  \\nTheory and Practice  \\nHabermas develops the following theses that exhibit the major concerns\\nof his early work, based on the following diagnosis: Capitalist\\nsocieties institutionalize the aim of economic growth, which has the\\neffect of expanding sub-systems of instrumental reason. In that\\ncontext, science and technology cease to be connected to a realm of\\nvalues that help people answer practical questions of how they want to\\nlive, and become absorbed instead into the economic and administrative\\nsystems as forces of production geared to the aim of continuous\\neconomic growth. Politics, instead of residing in a popular practice\\nof democratic self-determination, atrophies to the technocratic\\nadministration of public affairs in the hands of small groups of\\nexperts, leading to a depoliticization of ordinary citizens (Celikates\\n& Jaeggi 2009 [2017: 261]). The question is who can reconnect\\ntechnocratic politics with the “good life”.\\nHabermas’s answer is that students may be part of the solution,\\nsince their protests do not aim at securing them “a larger share\\nof social rewards”, but are targeted against the reduction of\\nsocial and political life to economic growth and individual gain\\n(1970: chapter 6, 120–122).'), Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Jürgen Habermas', 'Header 2': '1.

(1975), or to give the full original\\ntitle, (1973),\\nis a sketch of an incipient research programme that sets out from a\\ncritique of Marx’s social theory, which sees crises in\\ncapitalist societies as arising not from the immiseration of the\\nworking classes and class struggle, which have largely been pacified\\nby the welfare state and economic growth, but from legitimation\\ndeficits due to alterations in the constellation of economics and\\npolitics. The problem posed by legitimation crises, which are specific\\nto late capitalism, is how the increasing intervention of the state in\\neconomic affairs can be made legitimate to those who are affected by\\nthese state interventions, and hold the state responsible for their\\neffects. In conclusion, Habermas develops some hypotheses about how\\nsuch crises can be resolved. The best-case scenario is that\\nlegitimation takes place through discursive justification, on the\\nbasis of norms embodying generalizable interests, and, failing that,\\nthrough various kinds of compromise (1973a [1975: 112–114]). On\\nthis model normative structures and ideals of consensus become the key\\nvantage point through which societies can be understood and criticized\\nby the social theorist.  \\nLegitimation Crisis  \\nLegitimationsprobleme im Spätkapitalismus  \\nThis thesis is further elaborated in the collection of essays entitled (1976a). In\\nthis volume Habermas challenges the Marxian assumption that\\ndevelopments in the sphere of social integration are determined by\\ndevelopments in the sphere of material production. By contrast he\\nposits a logic of the development of normative structures, which\\nrepresent the institutional analogues of the stages of cognitive\\ndevelopment of moral consciousness in individuals as developed and\\ntested by the cognitive moral psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg (1976a:\\n9–49 [1979: 95–130]). These normative structures represent\\na directional sequence of discrete stages that gain in complexity and\\ncomprehensiveness as they develop, and make collective learning\\npossible. They allow different kinds of reasons to count as\\nlegitimations for the relevant kinds of social structures and levels\\nof social integration, and serve as normative standpoints in the light\\nof which societies can be understood and criticized. Crucially, they\\nexhibit a logic of development altogether independent from that of the\\nforces of production.  \\nZur Rekonstruction des historischen Materialismus  \\nAt the time, Marxists criticized Habermas’s work both for\\nabandoning central tenets of Marxism and for conceding too much to\\nNiklas Luhmann’s system’s theory (Ebbighausen 1976). That\\nsaid, Habermas denies Luhmann’s central claim that legitimacy is\\nnothing but the motiveless acquiescence of citizens to the binding\\ndecisions of an administrative mechanism (Luhmann 1969). As for\\nHabermas’s Marxism, the very focus of his transitional work on\\nthe system crises of capitalist society betrays not only the\\ntheoretical aspiration to understand capitalism, but also the\\npractical aspiration to overcome it, or at least to understand how it\\ncould be overcome. That said, since the theory of legitimation crisis,\\nas McCarthy noted, is not addressed to any agent of social\\ntransformation, it must ultimately remain content with diagnosing\\ncrisis tendencies (McCarthy 1978).'), Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Jürgen Habermas', 'Header 2': '2.

Habermas’s Mature Social Theory:', 'Header 3': '2.1 Habermas’s Pragmatic Theory of Meaning'}, page_content='While the theory of communicative action is designed to answer\\nquestions in social theory, Habermas also considers it as a\\ncontribution to the theory of meaning (1984b: 604). There are three\\npillars to this theory:  \\nThe first comes from Karl Bühler’s Organon Model of\\nlanguage according to which language is triadic, with three functions\\ncorresponding respectively to the objective world, the hearer, and the\\nspeaker (or the third, second and first person): a cognitive function,\\nan appeal function, and an expressive function.  \\nThe second pillar is speech-act theory, and in particular the idea\\nof illocutionary force or meaning, which was developed by J. L. Austin\\nand John Searle.  \\nThe third pillar is “formal semantics”, the\\ntruth-conditional theory of meaning, and in particular Michael\\nDummett’s “verificationist” critique of it.  \\nThese three pillars form the basis of what Habermas calls\\n“formal pragmatics” or the pragmatic theory of meaning,\\nthe basic idea of which is that “We understand a speech-act when\\nwe know what makes it acceptable” (1984a: 297 hereafter TCAI):\\nto understand what a speaker means the hearer has to have access to\\nthe reasons for the speaker’s utterance.  \\nThe first pillar, Bühler’s functional schema of language,\\nis important as a guiding assumption of Habermas’s theory.\\nHabermas sets so much store by Bühler’s model because it\\nencompasses the entire field of linguistic meaning, and gives equal\\nweight and priority to its three dimensions: what is intended by the\\nspeaker, what is said in the content of the utterance, and what is\\ndone with that utterance. All three dimensions are present in what\\nHabermas considers as the original mode of communication whereby a\\nspeaker, , reaches understanding with another person, , about something (1988b [1998b chapter 6: 279] [1992a:\\n58]). The triadic architectonic radiates into all aspects of\\nHabermas’s theory: the thesis that there are three validity\\nclaims: to truth, rightness and sincerity (TCAI: 307); that speakers\\ncan adopt three attitudes: an objectivating, a norm-conformative, and\\nan expressive attitude (TCAI: 309); that speakers through their\\nutterances take up relations to three “worlds”: the\\nobjective world of states of affairs, the social or intersubjective\\nworld of legitimate social orders, and the subjective internal world\\n(TCAI: 49–52, 60, 236, 308); and finally that there are three\\nbasic modes of speech which forms the basis of the classification of\\nspeech-acts: constatives or assertoric speech-acts, regulative\\nspeech-acts (such as imperatives or requests), and expressive\\nspeech-acts (TCAI: 309). Each of these triadic distinctions nests in\\neach other.  \\nS  \\nH  \\nTo the extent that there is an argument in for the triadic structure itself, it rests on the basic\\nclaim that there are three equiprimordial, meaning-critical validity\\nclaims. Every speech-act simultaneously makes a claim to truth, to\\nrightness, and to truthfulness. That means a speech-act can be taken\\nup by the hearer, and assessed in the light of its propositional\\ntruth, normative rightness, or the sincerity with which it is\\nexpressed. If accepted, this means that agreement\\n( ) is reached “simultaneously on\\nthree levels” (1981 [1984a: 307]). In defence of this view\\nHabermas argues that a speech-act can always be rejected from three\\nperspectives: in the light of its assertibility conditions, its\\nnormative justification, or the sincerity of the speaker (1981 [1984a:\\n306]; 1988b essay 4 [1998b: 231]; 1988b essay 6 [1998b: 296]; 1999a\\n[1998b: 317]). However, the claim that needs to be defended, not\\nassumed, is that the validity claim for every speech-act can be\\nrejected from three and only three perspectives. And as Dorschel\\nclaims, an assertion or utterance might be rejected in virtue of the\\nvolume or style with which it is uttered (Dorschel 1988: 8–9).\\nIn the final analysis, the “argument” that any utterance\\ncan be rejected from three and only three perspectives is\\nquestion-begging. So the triadic structure, stemming from\\nBühler’s schema remains best thought of as a hinge\\nassumption.  \\nTheory of Communicative\\nAction  \\nEinverständnis  \\nThe second pillar is speech-act theory. Because speech-act theory\\nconstrues speech as action, or, to use Austin’s phrase, as\\n“doing things” with words, it is well suited to provide\\nthe basis for a unified theory of meaning and action. According to the\\ntheory, a speech has both propositional content, , and\\nillocutionary force . So the meaning of an utterance —“the ice is thin”—can be both a\\nstatement about the way the world is, and, say, depending on the\\ncontext, a warning.  \\np  \\nM  \\nMp  \\nThat said, Habermas’s main focus is on illocutionary acts, the\\naims of which, in contrast to perlocutionary acts, he contends, can\\nalways be made manifest (1986b [1998b chapter 3: 202]). When a speaker\\nmakes a declaration or a promise they thereby signal to the hearer\\nwhat they are doing. The key to Habermas’s use of the term\\n“illocutionary” is that he identifies and specifies a\\nputatively universal internal mechanism by which speakers realize\\ntheir various illocutionary aims: they make validity claims for their\\nutterance in order to reach understanding ( or ). Speakers do this by making an\\nimplicit guarantee that they can, if necessary, adduce good reasons\\nfor their utterance. Hearers, for their part, are always free to\\nrespond with a “yes” or “no” (1981 [1984a:\\n302]) to this validity claim. When they respond with a\\n“yes”, speaker and hearer reach understanding or\\nagreement. “Reaching understanding is the inherent telos of\\nhuman speech” (1981 [1984a: 280]).  \\nVerständigung  \\nEinverständnis  \\nThe third pillar is formal semantics. To explain the notion of a\\nmeaning-critical validity claim, Habermas enrols Dummett’s\\nverificationist critique of truth-conditional semantics, and the\\nepistemic turn in formal semantics (1981 [1984a: 316–8]; 1981\\n[1998b chapter 2: 153]). Dummett argues that justification is an\\nepistemic idea, but truth is not, and that the truth-conditions of\\nmany sentences are unknowable, even where their justification\\nconditions are not. He proposes the view that we understand the\\nmeaning of a sentence when we know the conditions under which it is\\nassertible, rather than the conditions under which it is true (Dummett\\n1993: 45; Heath 2001: 120–121; Fultner 2011a: 60–62).  \\nHabermas takes Dummett’s thought and extends it to natural\\nlanguages, and to the pragmatics of meaning and understanding. This is\\nwhy he calls his approach “formal pragmatics”, rather than\\n“formal semantics”.  \\n[I]t is possible to generalize Dummett’s explanation. We\\nunderstand a speech-act when we know the kinds of reasons that a\\nspeaker could provide … claim validity for his\\nutterance—in short when we know what makes it acceptable. (1986b\\n[1998b chapter 3: 232])  \\nBut as Heath points out this is problematic. For there is a semantic\\ndimension to, and motivation for, Dummett’s idea that to know\\nthe meaning of a sentence is to know the conditions under which it is\\nassertible. It offers a unified explanation of the compositional\\nstructure of language, namely of how one can construct an infinite\\nnumber of meaningful sentences out of a finite number of semantic\\nunits and the rules for their composition. In turn that explains how\\nwe can understand the meaning of a sentence we have never encountered\\nbefore. This may work for assertions, but it is inapplicable to the\\npragmatic dimension of meaning, to the illocutionary force of\\nutterances, which lacks a compositional structure. So it is also\\nunclear how it would work for the other kinds of speech-acts such as\\nregulatives and expressives.  \\nThis strongly suggests, as Heath argues, that there may after all be\\nonly one validity claim that is “meaning-critical”, or\\n“internal” in the sense that it is constitutive of the\\nmeaning of utterances, namely the validity claim to the truth of\\nassertions or of the propositional components of other kinds of\\nspeech-act (Heath 2001: 115–6). It is potentially damaging for\\nHabermas also for another reason. It shows that to understand an\\nutterance that makes a rightness claim one need not know how the\\nutterance or claim is justified. Understanding an utterance need not\\ninvolve accepting reasons for action. Recall that Habermas insists\\nthat the illocutionary aim of the speaker is not only to be , in the sense that addressees recognize\\nthe of her utterance, but ,\\nin the sense that they also the relevant\\nreasons that the speaker could adduce in support of their utterance.\\nIn the case of utterances that make rightness claims these are reasons\\nto act or behave in certain ways. Habermas must establish the latter,\\nbecause his whole theory depends on the claim that the normative\\ncommitments unavoidably generated in speech reach over into the\\nsubsequent action sequence (1981 [1984a: 302–3]).  \\nunderstood  \\nsense  \\nagreed with  \\naccept  \\nHabermas later makes a move that appears to address this problem\\nwithout solving it: he claims truth to be paradigmatic of validity,\\nand rightness to be merely analogous with truth (1999a [2003a: 229]).\\nHowever, he does not say what the analogues are, nor does he explain\\nwhat the basis for the analogy is (Finlayson 2005). To claim that that\\nvalidity claims to rightness are analogous to validity claims to\\ntruth, in that they determine the meaning of the utterances that make\\nthem, and can play the role as a core component of a theory of\\nmeaning, is to beg the important questions.'), Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Jürgen Habermas', 'Header 2': '2.

Habermas offers a number of\\ntypologies. He distinguishes four different “models” of\\naction: teleological action, subdivided into instrumental and\\nstrategic action; normatively regulated action; dramaturgical action;\\nand communicative action (1981 [1984a: 85ff]). He later offers the\\nfollowing more rudimentary typology which divides action on the\\nhorizontal axis into success-oriented and consensus-oriented action,\\nand on the vertical axis between “non-social (individual) and\\nsocial action (1981 [1984a: 285]).  \\nAction Orientation  \\nSuccess  \\nConsensus  \\nAction Situation  \\nNon-Social  \\nInstrumental Action  \\n* * *  \\nSocial  \\nStrategic  \\nCommunicative Action  \\nAt the heart of this typology is the distinction between communicative\\naction (rationality) on the one hand and instrumental and strategic\\naction (rationality) on the other.  \\nHabermas defines communicative action in various ways but always to do\\nwith agreement on the basis of validity claims. In one place, he\\nclaims that it comprises “linguistically mediated actions in\\nwhich all participants pursue illocutionary aims and only\\nillocutionary aims” (1981 [1984a: 295]). That, however, is to\\nput the point too strongly since agents don’t only aim to\\nunderstand and to be understood (Steinhoff 2009: 35–6). A better\\ndefinition is that communicative action is action in which\\nparticipants pursue illocutionary aims “without\\nreservation” also when they pursue “perlocutionary\\ngoals” via “illocutionary goals already achieved”\\n(1986b [1998b chapter 3: 241]). This is important because Habermas\\ncorrelates instrumental action with perlocutionary aims and\\ncommunicative action with illocutionary aims, and he maintains that\\ninstrumental and strategic action depends on communicative action, but\\nnot vice versa. The idea is that agents, through their utterances,\\nmake validity claims (to truth, rightness and truthfulness) on which\\nthe meaning of their utterances depends, which are then taken up by\\ntheir interlocutors and form the basis of understanding and any\\nsubsequent interactions.  \\nIn response to the basic worry that he conflates reaching\\nunderstanding of an utterance with reaching agreement on a norm of\\naction, Habermas introduces a distinction between weak and strong\\ncommunicative action. He tends to make the distinction in terms of the\\ndifference between utterances for which speakers only make validity\\nclaims to truth, and those for which they make validity claims to\\nrightness and hence offer normative reasons that “bind their\\nwills” (1999a [1998b chapter 7: 327]). In weak communicative\\naction the reasons that determine meaning are also supposed to guide\\naction by providing information about the way the world is: in strong\\ncommunicative action the reasons that are supposed to determine\\nmeaning are action guiding because they are practical reasons based on\\nshared intersubjective norms (1999a [1998b chapter 7:\\n326–7]).  \\nHabermas contrasts communicative action with instrumental action,\\nwhich he takes to be action whereby agents select the best or only\\nmeans in order to achieve the agents’ ends (1981 [1984a: 285]).\\nHe construes strategic action as a social variant of instrumental\\naction, whereby agents seek to influence other agents, in order to\\nachieve their ends, often (though not always) via the medium of\\nlanguage (1981 [1984a: 285]). Habermas assumes that all action is\\nrational. But different action types involve different kinds of\\nrationality—instrumental and communicative. He also allows that\\nall action is broadly teleological, but claims that while instrumental\\nand strategic actions are oriented towards success, communicative\\naction is oriented towards consensus or reaching\\nunderstanding/agreement.  \\nHabermas’s conception of instrumental and strategic action has\\ncome in for much criticism. He tends to assume that all instrumental\\nand strategic action is egocentric and monological action, in which\\nagents aim to achieve their desired ends, and that they pursue these\\nends individually, not in concert with others. These assumptions are\\nbrought out when he contrasts instrumental and strategic action with\\ncommunicative action whereby  \\nthe actions of the agents involved are coordinated not through\\negocentric calculations of success but through acts of reaching\\nunderstanding. (1981 [1984a: 285–6, 288]; 1981 [1998b chapter 2:\\n118]; Celikates & Jaeggi 2009 [2017: 263–4])  \\nHe also assumes that strategically acting agents achieve their means\\nthrough influencing others. He allows that strategic actors can\\ncooperate, but claims that strategic cooperation is always\\nsubordinated to the satisfaction of the agents own individual\\n(egocentric) ends.  \\nSuccess in action is also dependent on other actors, each of whom is\\noriented to his own success and behaves cooperatively only to the\\ndegree that this fits with his egocentric calculus of utility. (1981\\n[1984a: 87–88])  \\nHabermas also assumes that in acting strategically an agent adopts an\\nobjectivating attitude towards others. Strategic actors coordinate\\ntheir actions with others by trying to influence them or manipulate\\nthem.  \\nHowever, many critics have pointed out that it is not the case that\\nagents who act instrumentally or strategically must act selfishly, or\\nmonologically, such that they are incapable of stable forms of\\nco-operation (Johnson 1991; Heath 2001; Steinhoff 2009; Blau, 2022).\\nThese assumptions appear to be imported from the\\n“traditional” action theories as Habermas understands\\nthem. Not only do these assumptions require independent justification,\\nbut they are also incidental to the basic distinction Habermas is\\nattempting to draw.  \\n2.2.1 The Unavoidability Thesis  \\nHaving drawn the distinction between communicative and instrumental\\naction, Habermas argues for two basic theses. Recall the starting\\nintuition of :  \\nTheory of Communicative Action  \\nThe idea of reason, which is differentiated in the various claims to\\nvalidity, is necessarily built into the way in which the species of\\ntalking animals reproduces itself. (1984b [2001d: 85])  \\nHabermas claims that in societies like ours, there is for language as the medium of\\naction-coordination and social integration. And if his reconstruction\\nof language use is correct that takes place through communicative\\naction:  \\nno\\nfunctional equivalent  \\nthe symbolic structures of the life-world can be reproduced only\\nthrough the medium of action orientated to understanding. (1982:\\n237)  \\nIf Habermas’s pragmatic theory of meaning is correct, then a\\nweak transcendental necessity transmits from the premises, that\\ncommunication and discourse are necessary to social reproduction, to\\nfeatures of his reconstruction thereof, such as validity claims, rules\\nof argumentation, etc. The transcendental necessity in question is\\nweak since the premises are contingent and empirical: they are not\\nthemselves logically or even physically necessary. And the\\nreconstruction is itself defeasible. Nonetheless, the reconstructed\\nfeatures, Habermas contends, are socially necessary for agents like\\nus—roughly agents of modern societies. Language exists, and\\nlanguage use is not optional for human beings. Linguistic practice\\npresupposes the structures and rules of communication and discourse\\nthat alone enable communication. So there is no feasible alternative\\nto speaking, making one’s utterances understood to\\ninterlocutors, and so of raising validity claims, and also, as we will\\nsee below, invoking the rules of discourse (Heath 2001: 295–98).\\nValidity claims, and the rules of discourse that govern the practice\\nof argumentation, are what Habermas calls “pragmatic\\npreconditions” of communication. This means that  \\n, these presuppositions be undertaken.\\n(Fultner 2019; Habermas 1999a [2003a: 85–86; 17–18])  \\nfrom the performative perspective of the participants in\\ninteraction  \\nmust  \\nThis is the “universality” expressed in the label\\n“universal pragmatics” which Habermas originally gave to\\nhis research programme (1976b [1979: 1–68]).  \\n2.2.2 The Irreducibility Thesis  \\nHabermas’s theory is that communicative action is the\\n“basic form of action” and that instrumental and strategic\\nforms of action are derived from, and parasitic upon, action oriented\\ntoward reaching understanding (1981 [1984a: 228]; 1999a [2003a: 86ff];\\n1976b [1979: 1]). This is a bold and controversial claim which\\noverturns the central “traditional” action theory which is\\nthat the basic form or rationality is means-ends rationality, and that\\nthe basic form of action is instrumental, and success-oriented.  \\nHabermas’s argument for the irreducibility thesis rests on his\\nspeech-act theory. He claims that perlocutionary meaning (roughly, the\\nintended or unintended ends that agents achieve through the use of\\nlanguage) depends essentially on illocutionary meaning, namely on the\\nreason-based consensus arising from the offer and acceptance of\\nvalidity claims, but not vice versa. The latter—the\\nillocutionary—is the “original mode of language use”\\nupon which he instrumental use of language is “parasitic”\\n(1981 [1984a: 288]). In latently strategic uses of language,\\nperlocutionary effects are achieved only through the unreserved\\npursuit of illocutionary aims. In other words, strategically acting\\nindividuals use language normally, giving their interlocutors to\\nbelieve mistakenly they are aiming at reaching understanding, when\\nthey are not (1981 [1998b chapter 2: 118]).  \\nOne problem with this argument is that Habermas recalibrates\\nAustin’s terms “perlocutionary” and\\n“illocutionary” so that they are inextricably bound up\\nwith instrumental/strategic and communicative action respectively from\\nthe start. So his argument virtually presupposes what it is supposed\\nto explain. Another difficulty is that it is unclear whether the claim\\nthat the normal mode of language use involves the illocutionary goals\\nof reaching agreement on shared norms and binding practical\\ncommitments, as in “strong” communicative action, or\\nnot.  \\nFor these and other reasons most commentators agree that Habermas\\nfails to establish the irreducibility thesis by argument (Baurmann\\n1985; Steinhoff 2009; Blau 2022). Steinhoff claims that Habermas’s arguments for the claim that communicative\\nrationality is irreducible to instrumental rationality fail, but that\\nthe reverse is true (Steinhoff 2009: 46) and the traditional theory of\\naction is correct. Others think that the basic distinction is useful\\nand can be justified by argument, even if Habermas’s own\\nargument is not clinching (Blau 2022; Heath 2001). Heath provides an\\nargument in the other direction which shows, contra Steinhoff, that\\ninstrumental and strategic action cannot account for language use, and\\nargues that this result can support Habermas’s contention, that\\ninstrumental and strategic action presuppose communicative action but\\nnot vice versa.

Societies should be conceived “simultaneously as\\nsystems and lifeworlds” (1981 [1987: 118]).  \\nThey are theoretical concepts, which enable social theorists to\\nexplain social order.  \\nThey are also ontological concepts that respectively denote two\\ndifferent kind of existing social order, or to put it another way two\\ndistinct but complementary mechanisms of social integration. In the\\nformer case, systems stabilize the  \\nnon-intended interconnections of action … by a non-normative\\nregulation of individual decision that extend beyond the actor’s\\nconsciousness.  \\nIn the latter, the lifeworld, social integration is brought about by\\nmeans of “a normatively secured or communicatively achieved\\nconsensus” (1981 [1987: 117]).  \\n2.3.1 Lifeworld  \\nOn the one hand, Habermas presents the lifeworld phenomenologically as\\n“a background stock of cultural knowledge that is ‘always\\nalready’ familiar to agents” and thus makes mutual\\nunderstanding possible. In this it has what he calls a “peculiar\\nhalf transcendence” that, unlike the formal notions of the\\nsubjective, objective, and intersubjective worlds, cannot be\\nobjectified and brought before consciousness (1981 [1987:\\n154–4]). On the other hand, he associates it with specific\\ndomains of social life—such as family life, everyday life, and\\ncivil society—in which communicative actions predominate, and\\nagents coordinate their interactions by means of speech-acts and their\\nunderling validity claims (Baxter 2011: 166; Heath 2011: 75). Either\\nway, the lifeworld enjoys a certain primacy over the system, since it\\n“remains the subsystem that defines the pattern of the social\\nsystem as a whole” and because systems “need to be\\nanchored in the lifeworld” (1981 [1987: 154]).  \\n2.3.2 System  \\nHabermas developed his notion of the system in his writings prior to , particularly through his\\nengagement with Luhmann (1973a [1975: 1–8]). Systems are\\nmacro-level processes that stabilize complexes of actions via steering\\nmechanisms. The two main examples are the economy and bureaucracy,\\nwhich function respectively via the steering mechanisms of money and\\npower. Unlike the lifeworld, systems fulfil their functions through\\n“a non-normative regulation of individual decisions that extends\\nbeyond the actor’s consciousnesses” (1981 [1987: 117]).\\nThis is a reference to an “invisible hand” mechanism of\\nthe kind that occurs in Mandeville, Smith, and Hegel, with the\\nimportant difference that in these latter theorists the invisible\\nhand, providence-like, serves the common good. For Habermas the\\nfunction of the systems of the economy and bureaucracy is merely to\\nharmonize and stabilize complexes of individual actions, and thereby\\nto bring about societal integration and reproduction. They act as\\nrelief mechanisms that ease the burden on communicatively acting\\nsubjects. Of course, in functioning societies the economy and\\nbureaucracies also serve the common good. According to\\nHabermas’s theory this only happens when the system bears the\\nright kind of relation to the lifeworld.  \\nTheory of Communicative Action  \\nshould  \\nWhen Habermas first introduced the idea of the system he was engaging\\nwith Luhmann’s work and thinking mainly of cybernetic systems\\n(1976a [1979: 170]; 1973a [1975: 130–142]). A good example of a\\ncybernetic system is a heater linked to a thermostat, where each\\nserves as input and output. If the heat rises beyond a fixed\\ntemperature, say 20 Celsius, the thermostat switches the heater off,\\nand if it drops below that temperature the thermostat switches the\\nheater on again (Heath 2011: 83–84). The result (or goal-state\\nto use the slightly misleading technical term) is to keep the room at\\nan even ambient temperature.  \\nHabermas construes systems, in the light of Luhmann, as spheres of\\n“norm free” sociality. “In capitalist societies the\\nmarket is the most important example of a norm-free regulation of\\ncooperative contexts” (1981 [1987: 150, 154]). This puts him on\\nthe side of those who see markets as destroying rather than nourishing\\nthe web of moral relations. His predominant way of thinking about\\nsubsystems is that they are “demoralized”. This is true of\\nthe market economy, bureaucracies and state administration, and the\\nlaw, which in he treats as a\\nsubsystem. That said, even in this text, while he claims that law in\\nthe process of rationalization becomes “detached from the\\nethical motivations of the legal person” (1981 [1987: 174]), he\\nnonetheless thinks of basic rights and the principle of popular\\nsovereignty as sources of legitimation which act as  \\nTheory of Communicative Action  \\nbridge between a de-moralized and externalized legal sphere and a\\ndeinstitutionalized and internalized morality. (1981 [1987: 178])  \\nSystems, which facilitate integration and social order through\\n“delinguistified steering media” like money and power,\\nhave great advantages for citizens of modern societies. They fulfil\\nfunctions that are too complex or burdensome to be undertaken by\\ncommunicative action, that is, by individuals acting consciously in\\nconcert. For example, markets distribute goods and resources to where\\nthey are most needed, using price signals and laws of supply and\\ndemand.  \\nHowever, systems also have disadvantages. For one thing, systems, once\\nin place, operate independently of human agents. There is,\\nconsequently, a gap between an actor’s agency, and their\\nconscious intentions and aims, and the purpose that they serve in the\\nsystem. This lack of transparency is evident in firms, for instance,\\nwhere the agents fulfil their roles and tasks, whether using\\ninstrumental, communicative, or moral rationality, or a mix of all,\\nwhile all the time behind their backs or “beyond their\\nconsciousness” at the macro-level they are making profit for the\\nfirm’s owners and shareholders. For another, Habermas claims,\\nagents operating in spheres steered by delinguistified media are\\ninclined to shift from communicative to instrumental and strategic\\naction orientations with the result that  \\nsuccess-oriented action steered by egocentric calculations of utility\\nloses its connection to action oriented by mutual understanding. (1981\\n[1987: 196])  \\nWhether Habermas holds that agents’ actions in economic and\\nbureaucratic domains are merely constrained by system imperatives of\\nthe relevant steering media, or reduced to instrumental and strategic\\nactions is moot (Jütten 2013). But it is empirically false for\\nreasons given by Honneth and Joas and others that the mediatization of\\na domain of social life would force agents to adopt only one type of\\naction. As Joas puts it, every sphere of action contains “a\\nwealth of different types of action” (Joas 1986 [1991: 104]).\\nSystems, economic and bureaucratic, and the specific organisations\\nthey comprise, all involve numerous different kinds of action. This is\\nnot only an empirical claim but a conceptual one that follows from\\nHabermas’s own theory that instrumental and strategic action is\\nparasitic on communicative action. Habermas has also been criticized\\nfor being seduced by systems theory into merely accepting spheres of\\nnorm free sociality, and the uncoupling of system and lifeworld as a\\nnormal result of modernization and social differentiation (McCarthy\\n1991).  \\n2.3.3 The Relation of Lifeworld to System  \\nThe relation of lifeworld to system is pivotal to Habermas’s\\nsocial theory. Most commentators (for example McCarthy 1991: 154 and\\nBaxter 2011: 166) take this to be the main problem facing the theory.\\nActually, as Habermas notes, there are two related problems: the\\nproblem of constructing a theory that can combine systems theory and\\naction theory fruitfully (1981 [1987: 201]), and the problem of\\narticulating the actual relation between system and lifeworld.  \\nSo what is that relation? Habermas accords primacy to the lifeworld,\\non the on the grounds that it “defines the pattern of the social\\nsystem as a whole”. Systemic mechanisms, he contends,\\n“need to be anchored in the lifeworld” (1981 [1987: 154]).\\nIt is tempting to think that Habermas’s thesis of the primacy of\\nthe lifeworld over the system must have to do with the primacy of\\ncommunicative over instrumental and strategic action, the view that\\ninstrumental and strategic action are “parasitic” on\\ncommunicative action, but not vice versa. However, that would be\\nproblematic since Habermas does not succeed in establishing by means\\nof speech-act theory that communicative action the basic\\nform of action on which instrumental and strategic action essentially\\ndepend.  \\nis  \\nEven if Habermas had an argument that conclusively demonstrated the\\nprimacy of communicative over instrumental action, that would not\\nsuffice to establish the primacy of the lifeworld over the system. The\\nprimacy of one kind of action over another could not itself establish\\nthe primacy of one kind of social order over another. That would be a\\nconflation of levels. Habermas does in fact quite often conflate types\\nof action with spheres of action, as we see from his claim cited above\\nthat success-oriented individual actions are “steered” by\\negocentric calculations (Joas 1986 [1991: 104]). For example, he talks\\nof “subsystems of purposive rational action” and\\n“normative steering” (1981 [1987: 180–1]).'), Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Jürgen Habermas', 'Header 2': '2.

Habermas’s Mature Social Theory:', 'Header 3': '2.4 Habermas’s Critical Social Theory'}, page_content='Habermas’s thesis of the primacy of the lifeworld over the\\nsystem gives him a framework in which to criticize neo-liberalism and\\nits mania for the marketization and financialization of everyday life:\\n“the whole program of subjecting the lifeworld to the\\nimperatives of the market must be subject to scrutiny”, whether\\nin health care, public transport, military security, or secondary and\\ntertiary education (2009: 186). He does this with his theory of the\\ncolonization of the lifeworld by the system.  \\n2.4.1 Colonization  \\nRecall that mediatization—the intrusion of steering media into\\nsocial domains that were hitherto not systematically organized and\\nintegrated—is not, according to Habermas, itself a pathological\\ndevelopment. It has a positive side, namely as a relief mechanism, a\\nway of coping efficiently with complexity. But colonization, as the\\nlabel suggests, is bad. Colonization occurs where  \\nsystemic mechanisms suppress forms of social integration even in those\\nareas where a consensus-dependent coordination of action cannot be\\nreplaced, that is, where the symbolic reproduction of the lifeworld is\\nat stake. (1981 [1987: 196])  \\nSymbolic reproduction is where society is maintained through\\ncommunicative actions. As a consequence of colonization, the lifeworld\\nshrinks, and its capacity for symbolic reproduction atrophies (1981\\n[1987: 154, 173]). This is functionally bad. To the extent that the\\nsystem, and society as a whole, depend on the lifeworld and its\\ncommunicative resources, colonization is self-stultifying and\\ndestabilizing.  \\nHabermas follows Marx and Weber on this, rather than Luhmann, insofar\\nas he shows that  \\nthe rationalization for the lifeworld makes possible the emergence and\\ngrowth of subsystems whose independent imperatives turn back\\ndestructively upon the lifeworld. (1981 [1987: 186])  \\nThis not only eradicates normative contexts of action but, he\\nmaintains, supplants these with instrumental and strategic action\\norientations, which he calls a “pathological de-formation of the\\ncommunicative infrastructure of the lifeworld” (1981 [1987: 375,\\n180, 181]). This recalls Adorno’s discussion of bourgeois\\ncoldness, but broadens and extends it and decouples it specifically\\nfrom the moral abomination of Auschwitz (Adorno 1966 [1973: 363]). For\\nexample, consider that once healthcare and housing are privatized and\\nseen as mere commodities, landlords can evict tenants because of rent\\narrears, and hospitals can turn away patients who cannot afford to\\npay, with no moral qualms or social responsibility, because they see\\nthese actions as merely economic transactions. Colonization is also\\nbad, according to Habermas, insofar as it leads to a variety of social\\npathologies pertaining to culture, society, and person, including loss\\nof freedom, loss of meaning, crises in legitimation, anomie, and\\nalienation (1981 [1987: 385; 142–3]).  \\n2.4.2 Reification  \\nHabermas presents his colonization thesis as a reformulation of the\\nLukácsian idea of reification that was so influential on the\\nfirst generation of Frankfurt School critical theorists, especially\\nAdorno (1981 [1984a: 399]; 1981 [1987: 1]). Lukács argues that\\nthe commodification of all domains of modern society, and\\nconsciousness thereof, has led to its “taking on the character\\nof a thing”, hence the economy and bureaucracy and the legal\\nsystem appear to subjects as a “second nature”\\n(Lukács 1971: 83, 86). Consequently they adopt a passive\\nattitude towards it, in theory as contemplation, in practice as\\nadaptation. This results not only in an illusion, but also in a kind\\nof inaction, since people see and treat things as natural, and so not\\nup to them, and not alterable, when such things are in fact historical\\nand in principle reversible, and up to them. That idea needs\\nreformulating, Habermas maintains, because it mistakenly conflates\\nrationalization and social differentiation with reification.\\nLukács, for example, thinks of rationalization as the\\ndestruction of social totality, namely the substantial ethical life of\\na community, as an unqualified bad, whereas Habermas sees it as having\\nupsides and downsides.  \\nReification is the major downside, which Habermas sees as a specific\\nalienating effect of the destruction of the communicative capacity for\\nsymbolic reproduction and social integration provided by the\\nlifeworld. In particular, reification arises when the intrusion of\\nsteering media causes the “conversion to another mechanism of\\naction coordination” (1981 [1987: 375]). Since this conversion\\nhappens as it were behind the backs of social agents rather than\\nthrough their conscious intentions and choices, colonization gives\\nrise to “objectively false consciousness” and its effects\\n“have to remain hidden” (1981 [1987: 187]). Notably,\\ncontra the Marxist tradition up to Lukács, the reification\\neffect arises in class-unspecific ways and thus the crises do not\\nprecipitate class conflict, which, Habermas argues, the welfare state\\nhas largely succeeded in pacifying (1981 [1987: 187]). Furthermore,\\nthough reification effects are “filtered through the pattern of\\nsocial inequality”, the latter is not one of the pathologies he\\nfocuses on (1981 [1987: 349]). He focuses more on welfare state\\nclientism, and juridification (1981 [1987: 357, 363–4]). This is\\none of the important differences between Habermas’s social\\ntheory and Rawls’s , and leads to a\\ncompletely different outlook in the diagnosis of social ills\\n(Jütten 2011).  \\nTheory of Justice  \\n2.4.3 Normative Grounds  \\nThis brings us to the third significant feature of Habermas’s\\ncritical social theory: the problem of normative grounds. In the\\nintroduction to Habermas\\ndescribes his project as “not a meta-theory but the beginning of\\na social theory concerned to validate its own critical\\nstandards” (Schnädelbach 1986 [1991: 8]), inviting the\\ncontrast with the critical “social theory” developed in\\nthe mid twentieth century by Horkheimer and Adorno, which, according\\nto Habermas’s criticism, had foundered on “the difficulty\\nof giving an account of its own normative foundations” (1981\\n[1984a: 374]). He also criticizes systems theory for failing to see\\nthe primacy and fragility of the lifeworld, its function of embedding\\nand facilitating all spheres of action, and its crucial role in\\nproducing and reproducing social order. Systems theory conflates\\nsystem and social integration and “deprives itself of the\\nstandard of communicative rationality” (1981 [1987: 186]).  \\nTheory of Communicative Action  \\nThis has led commentators to assume that the ideas of communicative\\naction together with the theory that in modern society socialization\\ntakes place through communicative action provide Habermas with an\\naccount of normative foundations, of the kind he claimed was missing\\nfrom earlier Frankfurt School theory. The trouble is that it is\\nunclear to what extent this is a functionalist theory, supported by\\nmainly empirical claims, or a normative one; and, if normative, in\\nwhat sense. As Herbert Schnädelbach was among the first to point\\nout, Habermas’s approach of rationally reconstructing the\\ncommunicative infrastructure of modern societies does not obviously\\nfit the bill here. Functionalist explanation is not normative\\njustification (Schnädelbach 1986 [1991: 21]). This also applies\\nto his reconstructed theory of reification (Jütten 2011). It is\\nclear that Habermas’s is a normative theory, to the extent that\\nif his diagnosis is correct, the “damage” done by\\ncolonization is not only social and structural, individuals too are\\nharmed and suffer as a result of it, and their legitimate expectations\\nare disappointed. This is the case whether or not they are\\n“wronged”. The problem can be put as a dilemma. Either\\nHabermas’s social theory is genuinely critical, in which case it\\njudges that a colonized lifeworld is bad and ought to be changed (and\\nsuch judgement requires substantive normative premises), or it stops\\nshort of such a judgement, and is hence not properly critical.  \\nMaeve Cooke argues that Habermas’s theory contains implicitly a\\n“utopian promise” of a rationalized lifeworld, that is\\n“reproduced through processes of intersubjective evaluation of\\nvalidity claims” (Cooke 1994: 162), so that substantial ethical\\nreasons ground its normative claims. Other commentators, such as\\nHonneth, assume that discourse ethics provides the account of its\\nnormative foundations that, according to Habermas, earlier critical\\ntheory stood in need of (Honneth 1985 [1991: 282]). However, there are\\nnumerous problems with this view. One is that the normative claims of\\ncritical theory stand in need of moral reasons,\\nrather than those reasons (Finlayson 2013a), and\\nas Schnädelbach points out it is not clear that Habermas’s\\nrational reconstruction of communication as discourse can provide such\\nreasons.  \\nsubstantive  \\naccounts of'), Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Jürgen Habermas', 'Header 2': '3.

In other words, discourse is\\ncommunication, for Habermas stipulates that communication just is\\nspeech oriented towards reaching understanding. But discourse is\\ncommunication of a special kind. When communication breaks down and\\nthe everyday shared meanings and understandings that normally\\ncoordinate interactions are disrupted, interlocutors have to switch\\nfrom action to discourse. Discourses are a “reflective form of\\nagreement-oriented action that …sit on top of the latter”\\n(1986a [1990b: 245–6]). Discourse is a higher order of\\ncommunication, with the aim of renewing or replacing a problematized\\nconsensus. To participate in discourse just is to provide reasons with\\nthe aim of convincing all interlocutors to accept a disputed validity\\nclaim. So, on Habermas’s view, discourse just is the language\\ngame of argumentation in which disputed validity claims are\\n“redeemed”, and when a validity claim is redeemed\\nsuccessfully the disrupted consensus is restored, renewed, or replaced\\nby a new one.  \\nOn this picture, argumentation is a rule-governed practice, not a\\nverbal free-for-all. Habermas identifies three levels of rules. First,\\nthere are the basic rules of logic such as the principle of\\ncontradiction, and the basic semantic rules of universalizability and\\nconsistency (1983 [1990: 86]). Second, there are procedural norms such\\nas the principles of sincerity and accountability, namely that every\\nparticipant must undertake, if only implicitly, to assert only what\\nshe genuinely believes and always either to justify upon request what\\nshe asserts or to provide reasons for not offering a justification.\\nThese are, contends Habermas, preconditions for all genuine\\nargumentation, i.e., argumentation conceived as a “search for\\ntruth” and organized like “a competition for better\\narguments” (1983 [1990: 87–8]). Third, there are the\\nprocessual preconditions that immunize discourse against coercion,\\nrepression, and inequality. These norms are supposed to insulate\\ndiscourse from all persuasive forces except the “unforced force\\nof the better argument”, and they must be followed, if a\\nrationally motivated consensus is to be reached.  \\nHabermas suggests that the following rules of discourse can be\\nestablished:  \\n(1)  \\nEvery subject with the competence to speak and act is allowed to\\ntake part in a discourse.  \\n(2)  \\na.  \\nEveryone is allowed to question any assertion whatever.  \\nb.  \\nEveryone is allowed to introduce any assertion whatever into the\\ndiscourse.  \\nc.  \\nEveryone is allowed to express his attitudes, desires, and\\nneeds.  \\n(3)  \\nNo speaker may be prevented, by internal or external coercion,\\nfrom exercising his rights as laid down in (1) and (2) (1983 [1990:\\n89]; Rehg 1994: 62).  \\nThe above list is not intended to be complete.

Every valid\\nnorm has to fulfil the following condition:  \\n(U)  \\nAll affected can accept the consequences and the side effects its\\ngeneral observance can be anticipated to have for the satisfaction of interests (and these consequences are\\npreferred to those of known alternative possibilities (1983 [1990:\\n65]).  \\neveryone’s  \\nHabermas first introduces (U) as “a rule of argument that makes\\nagreement in practical discourses possible” (1983 [1990: 66]).\\nIn phase one he begins with a justification of (U), and then infers\\n(D) (1983 [1990: 93]). The initial idea was that (U) was to be given a\\n“transcendental pragmatic” derivation from the rules of\\ndiscourse, and (D) inferred from (U). The nature of the putative\\ntransition between (U) and (D) however remains unclear (Lumer 1997:\\n49), and Habermas has not succeeded in clarifying it.  \\nIn the 1983 programme, after having distanced himself from\\nApel’s programme, Habermas proposes to justify (U) by deriving\\nit logically from two premises: (1) the rules of discourse and (2)\\n“the idea of the justification of norms” or “a weak\\nidea of normative justification” (1983 [1990: 92, 97]). Later,\\nin phase two, Habermas reverses the order of justification, and infers\\n(U), now designated the “moral principle”, from (D).

According to\\nKettner the fact that in phase two (D) is no longer the principle of\\ndiscourse ethics, but construed as “still neutral” with\\nregard to morality and law, together with the fact that (U) is now the , means that the grounding of discourse ethics\\nis normatively incomplete, and this effectively amounts to the\\n“disappearance” of the original project, which was\\nsupposed to show that the moral principle and the moral point of view\\nfall out of the success conditions for communicative action (Kettner\\n2002: 207, 211–12).  \\nmoral principle  \\nTo sidestep the absence (or failure) of a logical derivation of (U),\\nHabermas presents (U) provisionally as an abductive hypothesis (1996a\\nessay 1: 60 [1998a: 42]) where abduction is an inference to the best\\nexplanation. Ott makes an attempt to justify (D) and (U) as a\\nconjunction of pragmatic implications (Ott 1996: 42–45), while\\nFinlayson claims that U is best thought of as an inference to the best\\nexplanation, and both agree that it rests on supplementary premises\\ndrawn from Habermas’s modernization theory (Finlayson 2000; Ott\\n1996). This raises the question of what kind of justification of the\\nmoral standpoint Habermas has in mind. In he presents discourse ethics as a defence of\\na cognitivist account of morality against the moral sceptic on grounds\\nthat even the sceptic must accept (1983 [1990: 76ff]). The\\nphilosophical programme of justification looks like a\\nconstructivist—and what Gunnarsson calls a\\n“rationalist”—argument, invoking slender premises\\nand reaching thick normative conclusions, albeit the said normative\\nconclusions are not substantial moral norms, but a moral principle of\\nuniversalization, and an account of the moral point of view, in which\\nmoral agents (participants in discourse) collectively validate\\nsubstantial moral norms (Gunnarsson 2000: 99, see also Rees 2020:\\n678–81, 689–91). Gunnarsson argues that all\\nHabermas’s rationalist arguments for (U) fail. Benhabib is also\\nof this view. In an early critique she argued that (U) was redundant,\\nand that (D) should be given a “weak justification\\nprogramme” which adduced supplementary moral premises of\\n“universal respect” and “egalitarian\\nreciprocity” (Benhabib 1986: 308; 1992: 31). Habermas’s\\ntendency to add ever stronger supplementary premises for his\\njustification of (U) is a tacit acknowledgement of his failure to\\nprovide either a formal derivation or a “rationalist”\\njustification of (U). In doing so he moves away from his original idea\\nof providing a philosophical justification of (U), towards a more\\nmodest explication and reconstruction of the moral point of view,\\nwhich can be corroborated by insights drawn from an array of\\ndisciplines, including the moral psychology of Lawrence Kohlberg.  \\nMoral Consciousness and\\nCommunicative Action'), Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Jürgen Habermas', 'Header 2': '3.

This is\\nwhy (U) refers to the “interests” of everyone affected it.\\nBut on Habermas’s view universalization is thought of as a\\nsocial process that extends to the very self-conception of the moral\\nagent. Habermas’s guiding idea here is G. H. Mead’s notion\\nof “ideal role taking” (1988b: chapter 3 [1992a]; 1983\\n[1990: 56–68, 121]), in which moral agents learn by projecting\\nthemselves into the position of all other moral agents. This is a\\nprocess whereby agents consider “every interest involved”\\nand evaluate what is “good for everyone under the same\\nconditions”, a process that, according to Mead, leads “to\\nthe development of a larger self, which can be identified with the\\ninterests of others” (Mead 1934 [1962: 363]).  \\ncontent'), Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Jürgen Habermas', 'Header 2': '3.

But certain\\ndevelopments in phase two push back toward a Kantian conception of\\ndiscourse ethics (Heath 2014: 846). In , (U) is said to allow participants to agree on norms that\\nare impartial, and that have “categorial validity” (1992b\\n[1996b: 28]). And Habermas appears to hold, like Kant, that the\\nrational will is the source of moral obligation (1992b [1996b: 110];\\nKettner 2002, 212). Furthermore, the moral domain, which in phase one\\nencompassed the entire domain of action norms and values, later\\n“shrinks” to a domain of thinner, universal moral norms\\nwith characteristic overridingness and stringency (1991a chapter 6,\\n202 [1993: 91]).  \\nBetween Facts and\\nNorms  \\nIt is primarily Habermas’s introduction of a tripartite typology\\nof practical reason—the ethical, moral, and pragmatic\\nemployments of practical reason—that drives his return to Kant\\nin . In particular Habermas introduces\\na notion of ethical discourse that differs from moral discourse in\\nthat it addresses clinical questions such as “What is the good\\nlife (for me, or for us)?” and that is restricted in scope to\\ncommunities with shared values. Ethical discourses differ, he claims,\\nfrom moral discourses which deal with questions of justice, understood\\nas what is equally in the interests of all (1983 [1990: 180]; 1991a\\nchapter 5, 101–105 [1993: chapter 1, 3–8]; 1996a essay 1:\\n39–40 [1998a: 26–7]). He understands “justice”\\nnot as a political value, as the later Rawls does, but as the supreme\\nmoral value, and the designated value of moral discourse, on analogy\\nwith truth for theoretical discourse. Although he allows that many\\nquestions can be addressed by both ethical and moral discourses, he\\ndraws a sharp distinction between them and accords priority to\\nmorality over ethics (1983 [1990: 104]; 1991a chapter 5, 100–119\\n[1993: chapter 1, 1–17]). Ethical discourses always take place\\nwithin the bounds of moral permissibility, and on Habermas’s\\naccount no moral norm can be weighed against, or trumped by, any\\nethical value. Along with various communitarians, Charles Taylor and\\nMartin Seel both criticize Habermas on this point and defend the idea\\nthat the good (albeit construed in different ways) has priority over\\nthe morally right (Taylor 1989 [1992]; Seel 1995).  \\nBetween Facts and Norms  \\nThe ethics/morality distinction has also been a target of much\\ncriticism. Benhabib (1986), McCarthy (1991; chapter 7: 181–200);\\nPutnam (2002); and Kettner (2002), among others have shown that\\nHabermas cannot and does not maintain a sharp distinction between the\\ntwo. The main reason they give is that the notion of value that\\nHabermas associates with ethics bleeds into his conception of a valid\\nmoral norm. Indeed, Habermas himself acknowledges the existence of\\nwhat he calls a “hidden link” between justice and the\\ncommon good (1983 [1990: 202]), and “the remnant of the good at\\nthe core of the right” (“das Gute im Gerechten”)\\n(1996a essay 1: 43 [1998a: 29]). And he appears to think of this\\nrelation, not as threat to his conception of morality but as a feature\\nof it, namely that it rests on an underlying web of solidary relations\\nbetween human beings. Habermas claims that morality arose from this\\nweb of solidarity as a process of generalization and universalization\\nin the course of modernization, and, he claims, although solidarity\\nremains as the other side of justice ( moral rightness)\\nthis does not smudge the bright line between ethics and morality\\n(Habermas 1986a [1990b]).  \\nqua  \\nKettner objects that Habermas’s typology is dogmatic,\\nestablished by “terminological fiat” and that it should\\nnot be seen as an insight into the nature of practical reason (Kettner\\n2002: 208).

So Habermas must allow that the\\nconstituency of all participants in an actual discourse might be\\nsmall, at the limit two people, and that the constituency of\\n“all affected” by a norm might consist of every moral\\nagent and patient including the unborn.

The first was that the\\n“liberal” conception of the moral self is formal,\\nabstract, and gender-neutral. The second was that the moral self is a\\nmale self masquerading as neutral and universal. The suggestion is\\nthat morality/moral theory is complicit with discrimination against\\nwomen and patriarchal oppression. They aimed a similar criticism at\\nKantian, Rawlsian, and Kohlbergian conceptions of “the moral\\nstandpoint” (Benhabib & Cornell [eds] 1987a; Benhabib 1992;\\nMeehan [ed.] 1995). Among these feminist critics, some, e.g., Benhabib\\nand Meehan, were initially supportive of discourse ethics because of\\nits emphasis on including other voices, and its insistence its ideals\\nmust be won from the reconstruction of actual practices of real\\nagents. Later, their arguments were recalibrated and turned against\\ndiscourse ethics. Because the moral self is conceived as formal and\\nabstract, and because the moral point of view is characterized by the\\nformal criteria of universalizability and reversibility,\\nHabermas’s discourse ethics cannot accommodate the kind of moral\\nexperiences that, Gilligan maintains, are characteristic of women: it\\nis blind to the importance of considerations of care and\\nresponsibility for others. This leads Benhabib claims to a\\nprivatisation, personalisation, and devaluation of women’s moral\\nexperiences (Benhabib & Cornell 1987a: 7–9; Benhabib 1992:\\n152, 184). She argues further that “the restriction of the moral\\ndomain to questions of justice” results in “the\\nprivatization of women’s experience and leads to epistemological\\nblindness towards the concrete other” (Benhabib 1992: 164).\\nThere is some doubt whether Benhabib’s position amounts to a\\nrefutation of Habermas’s theory or an explication of it. The\\nuniversalization procedure imposed by discourse involves participants\\nin moral discourse imaginatively switching perspectives with concrete\\nother people.

That said, it is more like a\\n“two complex” conception, since the “tracks”\\nin question designate the formal and informal public spheres and each\\nof these is a complex. At the centre is the parliamentary complex, not\\nonly parliament but the administrative and judicial bodies\\naccompanying it. Parliament itself is a formal “public”\\nforum that is legally established and organized to take decisions\\n(1992b [1996b: 355]).  \\nIt is surrounded by and embedded in an “informal” public\\nsphere, an “open and inclusive network” of various kinds\\nof discourse—moral, ethical, and pragmatic—that form\\n“a ‘wild’ complex” that is not formally\\norganized, even though each form of discourse has its own internal\\ndiscipline. (1992b [1996b: 307]). (Habermas also calls the informal\\npublic sphere “civil society” to indicate that it is not\\nlegally or political regulated.) When deliberative democracy works as\\nit should, discourse and its outputs—moral norms, values, and\\nmore broadly public opinion—percolate into the parliamentary\\ncomplex through a system of sluices and channels (1992b [1996b: 355]).\\nThese inputs are then worked up in parliamentary discussion and debate\\nand eventually embodied in the form of laws and policies and returned\\nas outputs into society at large. As they have been shaped by public\\nopinion and shared moral values, and worked up through debate, they\\nfind acceptance by citizens on the basis of the reasons they embody.\\nThat is how, when things go well, according to Habermas’s\\ntheory, legitimate law is produced. Roughly, this is Habermas’s\\naccount of the production of the “validity” of modern\\nlaw.  \\nThis model can also be thought of in terms of the circulation of\\ncommunicative power from periphery to centre, whereby the unregulated\\nflows of communication and discourse in civil society lay siege to the\\npolitical system, “without, however, intending to conquer\\nit” (1992b [1996b: 487]) but in a manner than allows them to\\ninfluence judgement and decisions in the political system. The model\\nis supposed to explain how the embers of radical democracy can stay\\naflame within a modern bureaucratic state. Earlier models of popular\\nsovereignty presuppose that society is “an association writ\\nlarge” or a macro-subject with a sovereign will: citizens are\\nactually authors of the very laws to which they must submit, and hence\\nencounter these as an expression of, not a constraint on, their\\nautonomy. But such a model would only work, if at all, in small-scale,\\nethically homogeneous societies, with a very high degree of popular\\nparticipation, none of which applies to modern Western states (1992b\\n[1996b: 102–3]). By contrast, Habermas’s discourse theory\\noffers a picture where members of civil society can, through\\nparticipation in discourse, help shape public opinion, which through\\nthe circulation of communicative power from periphery to centre can\\nindirectly “program” or “counter-steer” the\\npolitical system (1992b [1996b: 372; 332]) by means of laws and\\npolicies that are “in the equal interest of all” (1992b\\n[1996b: 98; 154]). In this way, he claims, the political autonomy of\\nlegal persons is ensured since they  \\ncan at the same time understand themselves as authors of the law to\\nwhich they are subject as addressees. (1992b [1996b: 408 187])  \\nWilliam E. Scheuerman’s objection is pertinent here. On\\nHabermas’s view, a law acts as a “transformer”\\nbetween the communicative power circulating in civil society and the\\nadministrative power of the legal and political systems, and it has to\\ndo so if it is to facilitate social integration. However, this view is\\nincompatible with Habermas’s earlier conception of system and\\nlifeworld, according to which the former, which includes the legal and\\nadministrative system, remains a “block of more or less norm\\nfree sociality” (1981 [1987: 171]). And Scheuerman points out\\nthat, not only is it improbable that communicative power can be\\ntransformed into administrative power and counter-steer the political\\nsystem, but Habermas gives no detail about where this interface\\nlies—institutionally speaking—and how it operates.  \\nA more radical objection stems from direction of the Rochester School\\nwho consider that the very idea of a “common good” or\\n“the equal interests of all” that might be served by law,\\nis an illusion (Riker 1982).

The conclusion to the argument is a system of\\nrights, of five different kinds.  \\nBasic rights to the greatest possible measure of equal individual\\nliberties.  \\nBasic rights to membership in a voluntary association of\\nconsociates under law.  \\nBasic rights to the actionability of rights arising from the legal\\nprotection of rights-holders.  \\nBasic rights to the equal opportunity to participate in the\\nprocesses of political will formation and the production of legitimate\\nlaw.  \\nBasic rights to living conditions that are socially,\\ntechnologically, and ecologically safeguarded, insofar as this is\\nnecessary for citizens to exercise their civil rights 1–4\\n(1996b: 123–4).  \\nThe first three rights are supposed to arise theoretically from the\\napplication of the discourse principle to the form of law. These are\\nrights that citizens must grant to one another if they are\\n“legitimately to regulate their living together by means of\\npositive law” (1992b [1996b: 126; 82; 118]). The next\\ntwo—political and social rights—are practical and material\\nenabling conditions that ensure the effectiveness of the first three\\nrights. The first three rights, Habermas claims, are not specific\\nrights, but what he calls “unsaturated placeholders” for\\nspecific rights that have to “be interpreted and given concrete\\nshape” by actual citizens in response to determinate historical\\nconditions (1992b [1996b: 125–6]). This is crucial to\\nHabermas’s theory, because it purports to reconstruct the\\nability of citizens, from their perspective, to reciprocally grant one\\nanother the rights necessary for their common existence as consociates\\nunder law. That’s why he claims that he, unlike Rawls,\\ndoesn’t design “the basic norms of a well-ordered society\\non the drafting table”, and then apply them to society (1990d\\n[1994: 101]). In that sense, just as discourse ethics leaves the\\nvalidation of moral norms to participants in discourse, the discourse\\ntheory of law and democracy has to leave the political process of\\nestablishing a system of rights up to citizens themselves as much as\\npossible. This is the sense in which Habermas claims the discourse\\ntheory of democratic legitimacy is “strictly procedural”\\nand more modest than “normative political theory” à\\nla Rawls (Habermas 1995: 117 & 132; Rawls 1995: 175–177).\\nFor all that, unlike in discourse ethics where neither (U) nor (D)\\nhave the status of valid moral norms, Habermas nonetheless derives a\\nsystem of rights that for all the world resembles T.

He objects even while acknowledging that the various\\nrights are not yet saturated: they are not yet specific, historically\\nand socially determinate rights. But contra Cohen, on Habermas’s\\naccount, legal form, or modern “form of law” is a richer\\nidea than the mere rule of law, and refers to a complex of features\\nthat law has in a modern constitutional democratic state. As Baynes\\nand Zurn point out, Habermas’s theory reconstructs the way that,\\nvia the discourse principle, the form of law in modern—that is,\\npost-traditional and post-conventional—societies functions to\\ncompensate for the loss of shared traditions, and relieves the burden\\non citizens to reach reasoned agreement with one another and thereby\\ncoordinate their actions (Baynes 2016: 166: Zurn 2011).  \\nSome critics argue that Habermas is wrong to look for a justification\\nof basic rights that is functionalist, or merely “internal to\\nlaw”, one that sees them only as necessary conditions for the\\ninstitutionalization of the democratic process, or one that is\\nstrongly constructivist, that begins from slender premises that eschew\\nmoral or ethical considerations (Forst 2011; Larmore 1995; Michelman\\n1998; Bernstein 1996; and Cohen 1999; cf.

He\\noriginally developed it as part of an attempt to explain social\\nphenomena and to recalibrate critical social theory on the basis of\\nformal pragmatics.  \\nRational reconstruction is an approach that Habermas developed on the\\nmodel of Noam Chomsky’s universal grammar (1976b [1998b 1: 35]),\\nJean Piaget’s developmental psychology, and Lawrence\\nKohlberg’s moral psychology (1983 [1990: 33–41]). These\\nare theories that reconstruct universal human capacities—for\\nlanguage acquisition, cognitive development, and moral reasoning,\\nrespectively. Habermas’s use of rational reconstruction aims to\\nset out the structures, rules, and competences underlying lifeworld\\npractices. The targets of the method may also be described as the\\nidealizing, counterfactual commitments which participants in a\\npractice must make, in order for the practice to be meaningful or\\nrational for them (1999a [2003a: 85–6]; 2005b chapter 3 [2008a:\\n81–4]). To rationally reconstruct a practice is to turn the\\nimplicit “know how” of participants into explicit\\n“know that” (1976b [1998b: 33, 34–5]). For example,\\nrationally reconstructing the everyday practice of communication gives\\naccess not to the semantic of the speaker’s\\nparticular utterances, which is already explicitly known, but the\\nimplicitly known which the speaker follows in\\nsuccessfully communicating (1976b [1998b: 33]). Habermas calls this\\n“illocutionary” or “pragmatic” meaning.  \\ncontent  \\nrules  \\nThese underlying structures are  \\nbrought to consciousness through the choice of suitable examples and\\ncounterexamples, through contrast and similarity relations, through\\ntranslation, paraphrase and so on—that is, through a well\\nthought out, maieutic method of interrogation. (1976b [1998b: 40])  \\nThey are revealed not as timeless constants, but as they have\\ndeveloped over time, with their internal developmental logics\\n(Pedersen 2008: 463, 474–9). Habermas originally claimed that\\nrational reconstruction uncovers knowledge of universal human\\ncapabilities, “species competences”, rather than the\\ncompetences of particular groups or individuals (1976b [1998b:\\n34–5]; McCarthy 1991: 130–2). For example, rationally\\nreconstructing the practice of everyday speech uncovers the rules of\\ncommunicative action as such, not the grammar of a particular\\nlanguage. However, Habermas’s later description of the discourse\\ntheory of law and democracy as a rational reconstruction of “the\\nself-understanding of modern legal orders” of democratic\\nconstitutional states (1992b [1996b: 82], emphasis removed), evidently\\na local phenomenon, suggests that he has since modified the scope of\\nthe reconstructive method. Commentators are dividend on this point,\\nwith some distinguishing between an “empirical” variety of\\nreconstruction on display in the , and a “normative” variety in (Peters 1994: 119), and others arguing that the\\nsame methodology underlies both projects (Patberg 2014: 511–3;\\nhowever, see Gaus 2013: 561). This tension is partly resolved if we\\nremember that democratic law-making draws on general communicative\\ncompetencies, and makes use of pragmatic, ethical, and moral\\ndiscourses. The phenomenon is local, but the capacities involved are\\ngeneral.  \\nTheory of Communicative\\nAction  \\nBetween\\nFacts and Norms  \\nIn terms of his own work, formal pragmatics rationally reconstructs\\nthe communicative capacities possessed by all human beings, making\\nthem explicit in Habermas’s accounts of communicative action and\\nthe rules for redeeming validity claims (1976b [1998b: 22–4]).\\nThe discourse theory of morality does this for our capacity for\\nengaging in moral discourse, formalizing this in the (D) and (U)\\nprinciples (1983 [1990a: chapter 2: 37, chapter 4: 174–5]),\\nwhile the discourse theory of law and democracy does the same for the\\npractice of lawmaking in democratic constitutional states, formalizing\\nthis in the system of rights and the principle of democracy (1992b\\n[1996b: 110–1, 118–24, 287]). Importantly, Habermas claims\\nthat the theories produced by these processes of rational\\nreconstruction have the status of —they are not since they are\\nnot necessary claims, although they are supposed to be\\n“universal” in the sense that they are, at present,\\nwithout alternatives. Habermas sometimes refers to them having a\\n“weakly transcendental” status.  \\nfalsifiable\\nhypotheses  \\na priori  \\nWhether or not formal pragmatics accurately describes the practice of\\nhuman communication can only be decided , by the\\nfuture “success” or “failure” of the theory as\\nan input in further empirical investigations (1976b [1998b: 39]; 1983\\n[1990: 32]), with Habermas suggesting coherence between theories as\\nthe criterion of success (1981 [1987: 399–400]; 1983 [1990a:\\nchapter 2, 39]). Jørgen Pedersen has argued that it is still\\nnot clear what constitutes success and failure in this context, and\\nthus not fully clear how rationally reconstructed theories can be\\ntested (Pedersen 2008: 478–1). Karl-Otto Apel, similarly,\\nquestions what it would mean to falsify the “unavoidable\\npresuppositions of argumentation” itself (Apel 2002: 19).  \\na posteriori  \\nHabermas claims that knowledge of the underlying structures and\\ncompetences acquired through rational reconstruction can then be used\\nfor the purposes of social critique. Supposedly, a version of a\\npractice can be identified as pathological, or not fully rationalized,\\nif it does not meet the counterfactual idealization which the practice\\npresupposes (1983 [1990: 31–2]). Habermas thus identifies\\nsystematically distorted communication, invalid moral norms, and\\nillegitimate laws as deficits in communicative action, moral\\ndiscourse, and democratic lawmaking, respectively. Rational\\nreconstruction allows us to critique these actual practices according\\nto their own internal standards, rather than the critic’s\\narbitrarily chosen standards or the philosopher’s supposedly\\ntranscendental standards (1992b [1996b: 5]). Similarly, the\\ndevelopmental logic revealed by rational reconstruction can be used to\\nevaluate processes of historical development as progressive examples\\nof collective learning, or as regressive and pathological. As a method\\nfor explaining social phenomena, rational reconstruction is neither\\nmerely empirical nor hermeneutic; the principles it produces are\\nsupposed to ground a kind of social and political theory which is\\nneither “ideal” nor “real”, but somewhere in\\nbetween. Habermas’s claim that philosophy can find within\\ntraditions construed as learning processes a “standpoint of\\ncritical evaluation” (1996a essay 3 [1998a: 97]; 1992b [1996b:\\n5]) is certainly in the spirit of critical theory, but arguably in\\ntension with his other claims that that philosophy should “limit\\nitself to the clarification of the moral point of view and the\\nprocedure of democratic legitimation” (Habermas 1995: 131;\\nFinlayson 2019: 205).'), Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Jürgen Habermas', 'Header 2': '5.

He labels much of the history of Western philosophy as\\n“metaphysics”, counting Parmenides, Plato, Plotinus,\\nAugustin, Aquinas, Spinoza, Leibniz, and Hegel as metaphysical\\nthinkers (1988b essay 2 [1992a: 12–13]; 1988b essay 3 [1992a:\\n29]). He sometimes distinguishes between metaphysics proper and the\\n“philosophy of consciousness” or “philosophy of the\\nsubject” associated with the rationalism of Descartes and the\\nidealism of Kant, Fichte, and Schelling (1988b essay 3 [1992a: 31];\\n1988b essay 8 [1992a:, 158–62]), though it is not clear whether\\nthis should be considered a separate paradigm (1988b essay 2 [1992a:\\n12–13]) or simply a late stage of metaphysics.  \\nAmong the characteristics of metaphysics are:  \\nA conception of with its own unique method and form of knowledge, distinct from the\\nnatural and social sciences, which can yield special insights into the\\nnature of reality and the meaning of life. Plato’s theory of\\nforms is an excellent example of this, since Plato thinks that\\nphilosophy, with its dialectical method, can offer true knowledge\\n( ) of the forms, superior to mere opinion\\n( ) about the material world.  \\nphilosophy as the queen of the sciences,  \\nepisteme  \\ndoxa  \\nA substantive conception of from which the philosopher can observe reality as a whole.\\nThe metaphysical philosopher’s goal is to attain an\\nobserver’s perspective on reality, from which they can learn\\nuniversal and necessary truths.

Metaphysics assumes that ideas are primary and the\\nmaterial world secondary, and that to grasp the underlying\\nintellectual reality is to grasp the whole: “the structures of\\nbeing themselves are what is laid hold of in knowledge” (1988b\\nessay 2 [1992a: 13).

Habermas\\nthinks that this turn to introspective self-knowledge as foundational\\ntook place as a result of the pressure which natural science was\\nputting on metaphysics by the eighteenth century. It may no longer be\\nplausible that the individual subject can grasp “the structures\\nof being themselves” in thought, but they can at least grasp the\\nstructure of their own thoughts, and build on these foundations some\\ncertainty about the world. Kant’s transcendental unity of\\napperception (1988b essay 7 [1992a: 124–5]) and refutation of\\nidealism in the First Critique are the clearest examples.  \\nstrong\\ntranscendental arguments  \\nHabermas concedes that this is a stipulative definition of\\nmetaphysical philosophy, focused on idealism. Ancient materialism and\\nscepticism, medieval nominalism, and modern empiricism do not fit the\\nmould, but Habermas argues that they should be seen as\\n“antimetaphysical countermovements” within the horizon of\\nmetaphysics (1988b essay 3 [1992a: 29]). He often characterises modern\\nphilosophical trends of which he is critical as covertly metaphysical.\\nHabermas sees some trends as attempted breaks with metaphysics which\\nremain trapped within the paradigm (Nietzsche, Heidegger,\\nDerrida—1981 [1987: 83–105, 131–160,\\n161–184]), others as still being mired in the philosophy of\\nconsciousness (Niklas Luhmann’s systems theory—1981 [1987:\\n368–385]), and other again as deliberate attempts to return to\\nthe philosophy of consciousness (Dieter Henrich— 1988b essay 2\\n[1992a: 10–27]).  \\nPostmetaphysical thinking begins with the first generation of\\npost-Hegelian thinkers (Feuerbach, Marx, Kierkegaard) (1988b essay 3\\n[1992a: 39]), and includes pragmatists such as C.S. Peirce and G.H.\\nMead, speech-act theorists such as J.L. Austin and John Searle, the\\nlater Wittgenstein, and Karl-Otto Apel.  \\nAmong the characteristics of postmetaphysical thinking are:  \\nas a method (1988b essay 3 [1998b:\\n38]).

It opposes\\nscientism, the idea that the natural sciences have unique authority\\nand privileged access to the truth.  \\nRational reconstruction  \\nA “weak but not defeatistic ( ) concept of\\nlinguistically embodied reason” (1988b essay 7 [1992a: 142]).\\nPostmetaphysical philosophy conceives of reason as being historically,\\nsocially, and linguistically situated, embedded in the intersubjective\\ncommunicative processes of the lifeworld, rather than transcending\\nthem. The philosopher is a participant in these processes, not an\\noutside observer. Postmetaphysical reason is immanent in the\\ncommunicative practices of the lifeworld, and procedural (1988b essay\\n3 [1992a: 34–5]), rather than being the external Archimedean\\npoint of metaphysics. Habermas thus sees postmetaphysical thinking as\\nhaving a .  \\nsic  \\ndetranscendentalized conception of reason  \\nThe use of , rather than the\\nstrong transcendental arguments of metaphysics (Yates 2011:\\n41–4).

Validity claims are the clearest example (1988b\\nessay 7 [1992a: 142]; 1983 [1990: 19, 203]). Although they are always\\nadvanced from within a particular lifeworld context, they hold that a\\ncertain thing is morally right for the intersubjective world, or true\\nfor the objective world, as a whole. The claims raised are not just\\nvalid within the context of the interlocutors raising them, but for\\nall speaking and acting subjects, as they must be if postmetaphysical\\nphilosophy is to critique existing social and political conditions\\n(1988b essay 3 [1992a: 50]).

Unlike metaphysical philosophy, it refrains\\nfrom making ontological claims about matters such as the existence of\\nGod. In accordance with the postsecular orientation of\\nHabermas’s recent work, postmetaphysical philosophy remains\\nagnostic about such matters, while being open to the truth-contents of\\nreligious language.  \\nethical and ontological claims  \\nThe metaphysical philosopher is an isolated figure, aiming through the\\nuse of their individual reason to attain a neutral observer’s\\nperspective on reality as a whole and produce knowledge of universal,\\nnecessary truths. The postmetaphysical philosopher, in contrast, aims\\nat a participant’s perspective, working in dialogue with the\\nnatural and social sciences and making use of a situated, procedural\\nconception of reason. There is no transcendent Archimedean point for\\nthe philosopher to occupy, since we are all embedded in our lifeworlds\\nand our thinking conditioned by social, historical, and linguistic\\nfactors. What remains distinctive about philosophy as a discipline is\\nthat it can step back from the particular questions which the natural\\nand social sciences focus on and produce general knowledge about the\\nhuman condition; but this knowledge is now based on empirical data and\\nrational reconstructions, and as such is contestable and revisable.\\nPostmetaphysical philosophy no longer claims to be the role of judge\\nand usher of science and culture, assigning each discipline and\\ncultural practice to its proper place.

Habermas took up the term and developed\\nhis own distinct interpretation of it beginning with the\\n“historians” dispute’ of 1986. Constitutional\\npatriotism is the theory that in modern states the constitution can,\\nand should, take the place of the nation as focus of citizens’\\nfeelings of collective identity and the source of their civic\\nsolidarity. While originally concerned with specifically post-war West\\nGerman questions about history and national identity (1988a), and thus\\ndrawing on a rational reconstruction of the postnational form of\\nidentification developed in the divided Germany, Habermas later\\napplied the theory to modern states more generally, and to the\\nEuropean Union in particular (1998c).  \\nVerfassungspatriotismus  \\nNational identity, for Habermas, is a product of the modern era,\\ndating from the time of the French Revolution and the later Romantic\\nmovement. It was constructed by linguists, historians, and writers and\\npropagated through the education system and the public sphere. As\\nsuch, the nation is intermediate between traditional and\\npost-traditional forms of identity (1988a: 5–7; 1992b [1996b:\\n494–5]). In a traditional society, collective identity is\\naccepted unreflexively, as are the society’s conventional\\nmorality and worldviews. It is a supposedly natural, pre-political\\ngiven. Collective identity in post-traditional society, in contrast,\\nis adopted in a reflexive manner, in light of reasons given in the\\npublic sphere. While in reality post-traditional, the nation is\\nreified as traditional and quasi-natural, and projected into a distant\\npast. From the beginning, the nation played a political role in\\ngenerating civic solidarity among strangers. National identity\\nestablishes an abstract level of solidarity, transcending the\\nface-to-face associations which bind people in traditional society:\\nvillages, clans, and localities. The feeling that they belong to the\\nsame nation motivates individuals to make sacrifices for others who\\nthey have never met, whether in terms of redistributive taxation or\\nmilitary service (1998c [2001a: 64–5]). This was crucial for the\\nviability of democratic republics at the transition from traditional\\nto post-traditional society. Nationhood provides the cultural\\nsubstrate for the “nation of citizens” who govern\\nthemselves democratically (1996a essay 4 [1998a: 117–8]). But,\\nfor a number of reasons, the nation is less and less able to play this\\nrole today. For one, all contemporary nation states are increasingly\\nmulti-ethnic and multicultural, undermining the idea that a\\npurportedly homogeneous collective identity can act as the substrate\\nfor democracy. For another, the dangers of extreme ethnonationalism\\nare all too obvious: they generate in-group/out-group distinctions\\nthat can lead to discrimination, racism, and at the limit to ethnic\\ncleansing and genocide. Finally, nation states themselves are\\nincreasingly powerless in the face of factors outside their control,\\nsuch as global capitalism and climate change. This “postnational\\nconstellation” requires a different form of social integration\\n(1998c [2001a: 58–112]).  \\nLuckily, according to Habermas, the relationship between\\nconstitutional democracy and the nation is historically contingent\\n(1992b [1996b: 495]; 1996a essay 5 [1998a: 132–3]; 1998c [2001a:\\n76]). A modern society does not need anything as substantial as a\\nshared religion, way of life, or repository of values to serve as the\\nbasis of collective identity. A democratic political system can\\ngenerate its own civic solidarity. Supposing that individuals have\\nprogressed from a traditional to a post-traditional level of identity\\nand are willing to adopt a more reflexive understanding of their\\nidentity, the constitution can replace the nation as a source of civic\\nsolidarity and attachment. The democratic procedure of\\nconstitution-making not only produces legitimacy, as described in the\\ndiscourse theory of law and democracy, but can also serve as the basis\\nof belonging. The goal of constitutional patriotism is not, then, to national identity, but rather to it and deprive it of its political function. In concrete terms,\\nconstitutional patriotism involves citizens developing critical and\\nreflexive loyalties and attachments to their country’s\\nconstitution and the moral principles encoded therein. What results\\nfrom this is a collective identity with a political function.\\nCitizens’ status as joint makers and interpreters of the same\\nconstitution takes the place of their shared natality and status as\\nco-nationals. This view is in that it revolves\\naround the work of making, interpreting, and reflecting on the\\nconstitution, which takes place in the public sphere. It is in that it has a binding effect on the community of\\ncitizens, furnishing them with civic solidarity and a collective\\nidentity. The formation of constitutional-patriotic identity,\\nsignificantly, takes place at the level of opinion- and will-formation\\nin the public sphere. Unlike supposedly natural and pre-political\\nnational identity, it is formed in the light of rational discourse\\n(2004 chapter 6 [2006c: 76–9]).  \\neliminate  \\ndecentre  \\nconstitutional  \\npatriotic  \\nCritics of constitutional patriotism argue that it is either too\\n“thin” to play the role Habermas assigns to it, or too\\n“thick” to really be postnational and open to all, as he\\nclaims (Hayward 2007: 186–9). The first criticism is that the\\nuniversal moral principles encoded in constitutions are too abstract\\nand affectively thin to generate a sense of personal loyalty and\\ncollective belonging among citizens, compared to the thick bonds of\\nnational identity (1996a essay 5 [1998a: 132]; Canovan 2000). Habermas\\nrejects this criticism. Citizens interpret the principles found in\\ntheir constitution—which represent universal moral and political\\nnorms of democracy and human rights, and might be found in any\\nliberal-democratic constitution— . They internalize\\nthese principles, not abstractly, but in the context of the history of\\ntheir country (1996a essay 8 [1998a: 225–6]). Constitutional\\nprinciples become part of the “dense web” of a\\nsociety’s (and an individual’s) historical experiences and\\npre-political values (2004 chapter 6 [2006c: 77–8]). It follows\\nthat each country’s constitutional patriotism will be different,\\ninflected by the particular past that country has worked\\nthrough—Habermas notes that French constitutional patriotism,\\nmarked by a tradition of revolutionary democracy, will be different to\\nGerman constitutional patriotism, marked by the historical failure to\\nproduce a working democracy (1992h: 240–1). Far from being an\\nabstract, bloodless construct as critics have alleged, Habermas sees\\nconstitutional patriotism as intimately connected to each\\ncommunity’s particular history and culture, and to its concerns\\nabout identity and the common good—its ethical-political\\nself-understanding.  \\nin the light of their\\ncommunity’s unique historical experience  \\nThe same universalistic content must each time be appropriated from\\nout of one’s own specific historical life-situation, and become\\nanchored in one’s own cultural form of life. Every collective\\nidentity, even a post-national one, is much more concrete than the\\nensemble of moral, legal and political principles around which it\\ncrystallizes. (1992h: 241)  \\nThe second criticism is that supposedly constitutional-patriotic\\nidentity is, in reality, the thick identity of the dominant majority\\nculture, albeit disguised (Laborde 2002: 593–9).\\nHabermas’s argument that constitutional principles are\\ninterpreted in the light of particular histories plays into this\\ncriticism. If a particular country’s constitutional patriotism\\nis so closely bound up with its ethical-political self-understanding,\\nthen the language, culture, beliefs, and values of that\\ncountry’s majority culture will make a deep impression on it.\\nConstitutional patriotism consequently collapses into civic\\nnationalism. At the same time, Habermas’s claim that the\\nconnection between national identity and constitutional democracy is\\nmerely contingent holds open the possibility that, even if they have\\noverlapped in the past and the present, an ongoing learning process\\nmay lead to the two being fully decoupled in the future (1998c [2001a:\\n101–2]). A further question, articulated by Andrea Baumeister\\namong others, is whether the liberal-democratic values which are to be\\ninterpreted in the light of national histories are, in fact, as widely\\naccepted as Habermas believes (Baumeister 2007: 491–5). If not,\\nconstitutional patriotism may be more particularistic and Eurocentric\\nthan it at first appears, raising questions about how those who do not\\nadhere to such values are to be integrated into\\nconstitutional-patriotic polities.  \\nHabermas’s longstanding support for a European constitution\\n(2001c [2006g]; 1996a essay 6 [1998a]) can be explained by his hope\\nthat a European constitutional patriotism would provide the civic\\nsolidarity that would allow the transnational polity of the European\\nUnion to fulfil its democratic potential (2004 chapter 6 [2006c]).'), Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Jürgen Habermas', 'Header 2': '6.

After some early explorations (1996a essay 7\\n[1998a]), he rejects a Kantian version of cosmopolitanism, arguing for\\na “politically constituted world society” (2004 chapter 8\\n[2006c: 161]) rather than a world republic or a global federation. His\\nfocus is the “constitutionalization of international law”\\n(2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 132–5]) a world\\ngovernment, with the limited aims of ensuring peace and protecting\\nhuman rights, rather than democracy on a global scale. Habermas pays\\nparticular attention to the different types of legitimation which\\ndifferent levels of global governance would require, and the different\\ntypes of constitution they would need.  \\nwithout  \\nIn Kant looks forward to the transformation\\nof international law, with states as its subjects, into cosmopolitan\\nlaw, with global citizens as its subjects.

Both can act as the\\nfounding subjects of a world constitution (2009 chapter 7: 119; 2011\\n[2012: 58]).  \\nPerpetual Peace,  \\nand  \\nHabermas describes “a multilevel political system that does not\\nassume a state-like character as a whole” (2004 chapter 8\\n[2006c: 144]), divided into three levels (2005b chapter 11 [2008a:\\n322–7]), each with its own form of legitimation and type of\\nconstitution:  \\nnation states (2009 chapter 7:\\n115–6). Although they are no longer fully sovereign in a\\nglobalized world, states still have the monopoly on the use of force\\nwithin their territories. They are based on a defined self-legislating\\ndemos (“national” or otherwise), which gives itself laws\\nby following democratic procedures, thus linking the rule of law to\\ndemocracy. In other words, states have a more “republican”\\ntype of constitution, which gives a central role to popular\\nsovereignty established in a revolutionary moment (1998d [2001a:\\n116–8]; 2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 122]). They can have full\\ndemocratic legitimacy, as described in , since within a state the authors of law can also be its\\naddressees (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 141]). States have the highest\\nrequirements of legitimacy within Habermas’s model. They have\\ntwo functions: firstly, to provide military force for implementing\\nhuman rights and policy decisions of the higher levels (2005b chapter\\n11 [2008a: 320–321]), and secondly, to generate indirect\\npolitical legitimacy for the higher levels.  \\nNational:  \\nBetween Facts and\\nNorms  \\ncontinental blocs like the EU,\\nHabermas’s prime example of a transnational polity, along with\\nits less-integrated siblings such as ASEAN and Mercosur (2005b chapter\\n11 [2008a: 325–6]). Great powers such as the USA, China, Russia,\\nand India also operate at the transnational level (2009 chapter 7:\\n114), as do economic organizations such as the WTO, IMF, and World\\nBank; and UN agencies such as the WHO and UNESCO (2011 [2012: 56]).\\nThis is the most “pluralist” level in Habermas’s\\nmodel, since it contains very different types of polities, and\\nincludes ones which are both liberal and illiberal, democratic and\\nnon-democratic. At the transnational level there exists a\\n“global domestic politics” (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 136,\\n160]) addressing socioeconomic questions. Issues of wealth and\\nredistribution, health and disease, trade, migration, and\\nenvironmental policy can be discussed within and between transnational\\npolities. Habermas still considers relations in and between them to\\ncount as international relations or foreign policy, although recourse\\nto war should be ruled out (2005b chapter 11 [2008a: 325]). The\\nnormative yardstick for relations between transnational polities is\\nfair negotiation, not the full democratic legitimacy which can exist\\nwithin states (2009 chapter 7: 125–6; 2011 [2012: 57, 68]). They\\nare nonetheless open to the influence of deliberative publics from\\nbelow, and should institutionalize some degree of citizen\\nparticipation, via referenda or mechanisms for responding to\\ntransnational public spheres. Transnational polities also receive some\\nindirect legitimation in virtue of their member states being\\nlegitimate (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 142]). They thus have middling\\nrequirements of legitimacy, which can be generated in a number of\\ndirect and indirect ways, and may have several different types of\\nconstitutions.  \\nTransnational:  \\nglobal organizations with\\nuniversal membership, comprising both individuals and states as\\nmembers. Habermas envisages a reformed United Nations as the central\\ncomponent of the supranational layer, along with a stronger version of\\nthe International Criminal Court (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 133–4,\\n173–4]). Their remit is strictly to secure peace and prevent\\nhuman rights violations (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 136]; 2005b chapter 11\\n[2008a: 322]; 2011 [2012: 60–1]), with the security council\\nperforming an executive function, the ICC a judicial function, and the\\nUN Charter acting as a supranational constitution (2004 chapter 8\\n[2006c: 160–1]; 2009 chapter 7: 120). A reformed General\\nAssembly could function as a world parliament, containing\\nrepresentatives of both states and cosmopolitan citizens (2009 chapter\\n7: 120–1), with its deliberations focused on interpreting and\\nelaborating the meaning of the Charter, rather than the kind of\\npolitical will-formation which takes place within national parliaments\\n(2011 [2012: 60–1, 65]). All other cross-border political issues\\nshould be dealt with at the transnational level—the\\nsupranational level is the preserve of law, rather than politics\\n(2005b chapter 11 [2008a: 333–4, 343]; 2011 [2012: 65]).  \\nSupranational:  \\nThis division of labour has drawn criticism, with Cristina Lafont\\narguing that the relegation of all socioeconomic issues to the\\ntransnational layer ensures that human rights violations stemming from\\nglobal inequality cannot be addressed (Lafont 2008). Habermas’s\\nsuggestion that the “slender but robust” cross-cultural\\nconsensus on basic human rights is enough to legitimate the\\nsupranational level’s policies (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 143];\\n2005b chapter 11 [2008a: 343–4]) has also been criticized. There\\nis room for doubt on this point, especially with regard to contentious\\ncases such as LGBT rights (1998d [2001a: 113–129]; Scheuerman\\n2008: 143–5).  \\nSince it is neither democratic nor a state, the supranational level\\nhas the lowest requirements of legitimacy (2004 chapter 8 [2006c:\\n133–4, 143]; 2011 [2012: 65]), and is not suited to a republican\\ntype of constitution, contra Kant. It is suited to a liberal type of\\nconstitution, which prioritizes the rule of law rather than popular\\nsovereignty (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 137–9]). A liberal\\nconstitution constrains established power in accordance with human\\nrights, but does not connect it to the will of a self-legislating\\ndemos, which is in any case lacking at the global level (2005b chapter\\n11 [2008a: 316]). Instead, the supranational level derives its\\nlegitimacy directly from the negative duties which it enforces (to\\nprevent human rights abuses and wars of aggression), and indirectly\\nfrom the legitimacy of the states which comprise it (2004 chapter 8\\n[2006c: 140–1, 143]; 2005b chapter 11 [2008a: 342–4]).\\nThis may be supplemented by the periodic emergence of a global public\\nsphere, mobilised in opposition to wars of aggression or in\\ncondemnation of gross human rights violations (2004 chapter 8 [2006c:\\n142]; 2005b chapter 11 [2008a: 343–4]; 2009 chapter 7:\\n124–5).  \\nIn this model, supranational law is to have primacy over state law, in\\nmuch the same way that EU law has primacy over the laws of member\\nstates (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 137]). The plausibility of\\nHabermas’s proposals depends on two learning processes.\\nIndividuals must learn to think and act as both national and\\ncosmopolitan citizens, switching between a perspective that centres\\nnational interest and one that centres universal standards of justice\\n(2009 chapter 7: 116–8), while states must learn to regard\\nthemselves as members of an international community, not absolute\\nsovereigns (2011 [2012: 61]). Habermas regards the\\nconstitutionalization of international law as the “legal\\ndomestication of the intensified cooperation between states”\\n(2014: 8), by which the Hobbesian state of nature at the global level\\ncan be gradually regulated and subject to law without the need for a\\nglobal government, which could not in any case be fully legitimate.\\nSome degree of global governance is unavoidable in the contemporary\\npostnational constellation.

In religious belief the validity claims of objective truth,\\nmoral rightness, and sincerity, and along with them the objective,\\nintersubjective, and subjective world-relations, were fused together.\\nSpeakers could not thematize and contest them (1981 [1984a: 214]; 1981\\n[1987: 189]).

That which was\\nin accord with society’s ritually protected normative consensus\\nwas right, that which violated it was wrong, and the consensus itself\\nwas beyond questioning. The transition to modernity begins with the\\n“linguistification of the sacred”, in which “the\\nauthority of the holy is gradually replaced by the authority of an\\nachieved consensus” (1981 [1987: 77, see also 288]). Normative\\nconsensus and social integration are achieved in modern societies\\nthrough communicative action, carried out by competent speaking and\\nacting subjects who have mastered all three validity claims and\\nworld-relations (1981 [1987: 107, 145]).

Maeve Cooke suggests that this process\\nof ethical appropriation involves re-presenting the semantic contents\\nof ethical insights, shorn of their religious, literary, and artistic\\ncontexts, such that their exemplary force in disclosing visions of the\\ngood remains intact and can be used in secular ethical discourses\\n(Cooke 2011).  \\nPhilosophy, too, has a long history of appropriating or translating\\nconcepts from religious traditions (2012 chapter 4 [2017:\\n63–4]). Many apparently secular philosophical ideas have\\ngenealogies stretching back to religion. Alongside well-known examples\\nsuch as Schelling and Hegel’s concept of the Absolute (2005c:\\n304), Benjamin’s use of the Messiah, and Adorno’s use of\\nthe ban on graven images (2005b chapter 8 [2008a: 232]), Habermas\\ndiscusses several examples from Kant: the , the\\nethical community, moral faith, radical evil, and even the moral law\\nitself can be seen as secular philosophical translations of the\\nkingdom of God, the church, religious faith, original sin, and the Ten\\nCommandments (2001b chapter 2 [2003b: 110]; 2005b chapter 11 [2008a:\\n220–3, 224–6]).

Despite\\nthis, Habermas insists that philosophical discourse itself remains\\nsecular, retaining its “methodological atheism” (2005c:\\n304, 309; 2002 chapter 8: 160)—it appropriates religious\\nconcepts, but they do not religious concepts.

It seems as if\\nphilosophy is able to judge which elements of religion count as\\nrational enough to be worth appropriating, and which can be discarded\\nas irrational; religion is reduced to a fund of concepts for\\nphilosophy’s use (2012 chapter 4 [2017: 63]). Habermas resists\\nthis interpretation, arguing against a Kantian view in which pure\\nrational faith should eventually replace historical faiths (2005b\\nchapter 8 [2008a: 223]), or a Hegelian view in which religion is one\\nmoment in the dialectic of absolute spirit, soon to be sublated into\\nphilosophy (2005b chapter 8 [2008a: 230–1]).

He uses this expression  \\nto describe modern societies which must assume that religious groups\\nwill continue to exist and that different religious traditions will\\nremain relevant, even if the societies themselves are largely\\nsecularized. (2012 chapter 4 [2017: 63])  \\nHis postsecular political theory, then, applies mostly to European and\\nother Western countries with an established tradition of secular\\ndemocracy, which must take account of the presence of religious\\nminorities (2009 chapter 5: 59). One alleged problem with earlier\\nmodels of deliberative democracy, such as those outlined by Rawls in or by Habermas himself in , is that they place unfair cognitive burdens on\\nreligious citizens of secular states, and in doing so threaten to\\nundermine these states’ legitimacy. The central issue is the\\nexclusion of religious language from the public sphere, and it can be\\naddressed by modifying the discourse theory of law and democracy so as\\nto let religious citizens participate fully. Habermas identifies two\\nproblems with secular deliberative democracy. It forces religious\\ncitizens to “split their identities” between public\\n(secular) and private (religious) personae (2005b chapter 5 [2008a:\\n126–7, 130]), and places asymmetrical burdens upon them,\\ncompared with their secular fellow citizens. Consider Rawls’s\\n“duty of civility” which required citizens not to make use\\nof their comprehensive doctrines while deliberating in public, and to\\nrestrict themselves to political conceptions of justice, which are\\nwithin the bounds of public reason (Rawls 1995 [1996: 217]). Or\\nconsider Rawls’s later, more moderate view, namely the proviso\\nwhich allows that citizens can adduce “comprehensive\\nreasons” in public political discussion, provided that “in\\ndue course” these are replaced by proper political reasons\\n(Rawls 1993 [2005: 462, l]). Following Paul Weithman and Nicholas\\nWolterstorff (Weithman 2002; Audi & Wolterstorff 1997), Habermas\\nobjects to Rawls’s proviso for placing morally unacceptable\\nburdens on citizens of faith, since  \\nPolitical Liberalism  \\nBetween\\nFacts and Norms  \\nmany religious citizens would not be able to undertake such an\\nartificial division within their own minds without jeopardizing the\\npious conduct of their lives. (2005b chapter 5 [2008a: 127])  \\nHe also claims that burden is unfairly distributed, weighing only on\\nbelievers (2001b chapter 2 [2003b: 109]; 2005b chapter 5 [2008a:\\n136]). Some critics have countered that identity-splitting can also\\naffect non-believers (Boettcher 2009; Holst & Molander 2015),\\nwhile others rejoin that it is a reasonable demand to make of modern\\ndemocratic citizens in pluralist societies, which does not threaten\\ntheir complex identities (Mautner 2014: 24; Finlayson 2019: 11).\\nHabermas, however, argues that both objections apply to Rawls’s\\nidea of public reason, governed by the proviso.  \\nNow, Habermas’s account of legitimate law-making in is wedded to the principle of the separation of\\nchurch and state, and has an unabashedly secular conception of\\npolitics. The principle of democracy implies that laws are legitimate\\nwhen citizens’ contributions to the filter through into the (the\\nstate apparatus, parliaments, and legal systems), and influence\\nlaw-making (1992b [1996b: 371–2, 441–2]). When this cycle\\nof feedback is operating correctly, citizens can understand themselves\\nas the “authors and addressees” of the law (1992b [1996b:\\n120]), since they have indirectly participated in the legislative\\nprocess.  \\nBetween\\nFacts and Norms  \\ninformal public\\nsphere  \\nformal public sphere  \\nHowever, religious citizens cannot contribute authentically to a\\nsecular public sphere. Their contributions to public discourse, if\\nphrased in secular language, will have little meaning for them, and\\nthus they will find themselves in the heteronomous position of only\\nbeing the addressees of the law, not its authors (2005b chapter 5\\n[2008a: 128, 130]). Habermas fears that the secular nature of the\\npublic sphere prevents religious citizens from fully taking part in\\nthe discursive processes which legitimate laws. They might comply\\nstrategically, seeing the law as a mere fact, and not a norm, but for\\nthem the laws passed by secular democratic states would lack\\nlegitimacy. There is evidently a danger here of large numbers of\\nreligious believers becoming alienated from democratic law-making,\\nwith the concomitant danger of political instability and a\\nlegitimation crisis (2009 chapter 5: 76).  \\nThe problem is how to construe and design the modern political system\\nin a way that is more congenial to religious citizens, without\\nabandoning the secular political state, and how to show that the\\nWeithman/Wolterstorff objections, which Habermas agrees apply\\nRawls’s proviso, do not apply to his own theory. His proposed\\nsolution, a model of , has\\ntwo elements corresponding respectively to the formal and informal\\npublic spheres; namely to the political system and civil society.  \\npostsecular deliberative democracy  \\nFirst, echoing Rawls, Habermas proposes an “institutional\\ntranslation proviso” at the threshold between the informal and\\nformal public spheres. In the formal public sphere, public officials,\\npoliticians, and judges must restrict themselves to secular language,\\nbut in the informal public sphere, ordinary citizens are free to\\ncontribute to public discourse in religious language (2009 chapter 5:\\n76; 2005b chapter 5 [2008a 130–2]). Before these religious\\nstatements pass through into the formal public sphere and impact the\\nlegislative process, they are to be translated into secular terms, a\\ncooperative task in which both religious and non-religious citizens\\ntake part (2005b chapter 5 [2008a: 112–3]; 2012 chapter 7 [2017:\\n172]). The institutional translation proviso thus acts as a filter,\\nmaintaining the secular nature of the state, but allowing religious\\ncitizens free reign to air their religious reasons in informal public\\ndiscourse (2005b chapter 5 [2008a: 131]).  \\nSecond, religious and non-religious citizens in civil society must\\nundergo complementary learning processes, leading to them becoming\\nreflexive about their beliefs (2005b chapter 5 [2008a: 111–2]).\\nFor religious believers, this involves coming to terms with three\\naspects of modern society: reasonable pluralism, the priority of\\nscientific knowledge, and the secular nature of the state (2001b\\nchapter 2 [2003b: 104]; 2005b chapter 5 [2008a: 137]; 2012 chapter 7\\n[2017: 173]). For non-believers, it involves accepting the continuing\\npresence of religion in modern society, coming to view their\\ndisagreements with believers as reasonable, accepting that believers\\nhave a right to contribute to the public sphere in religious language,\\nbeing willing to help translate those contributions into secular\\nlanguage, and finally forgoing scientism, and scientistically\\nmotivated atheism, in favour of political agnosticism (2005b chapter 4\\n[2008a: 113]; 2005b chapter 8 [2008a: 263–4]; 2005b chapter 10\\n[2008a: 309–10]; see also Baxter 2011: 205).  \\nTaken together, Habermas claims, these learning processes help to\\nequalize the cognitive burdens borne by religious and non-religious\\ncitizens. This model of postsecular deliberative democracy, Habermas\\nargues, solves the problems of identity-splitting and de-legitimation\\nwhich secularism inflicts on religious believers. Since they can now\\ncontribute to the informal public sphere in religious language,\\nbelievers no longer have to split their identities in two; since they\\nknow that their religiously based contributions are making an impact\\non the formal public sphere, they can see the laws which it produces\\nas legitimate.  \\nEven if the religious language is the only one which they speak in\\npublic, and if religiously justified opinions are the only ones they\\ncan or wish to contribute to political controversies, they\\nnevertheless understand themselves as members of a , which empowers them to be the authors of laws to which\\nthey are subject as addressees. (2005b chapter 5 [2008a:\\n130–1])  \\ncivitas\\nterrena  \\nHabermas’s theory has come in for criticism from all sides. On\\nthe one hand critics like Amy Allen claim that there is a residual\\nasymmetry, and that Habermas still “stacks the decks in favour\\nof secularism” (Allen 2013: 149). Wolterstorff agrees, though he\\nthinks the problem lies with the idea of “post-metaphysical\\nreason”, while Allen traces it to his “genealogy of\\npost-secular reason”. Cristina Lafont argues, by contrast, that\\nthe asymmetric burden falls the other way, since the cognitive\\nlearning process imposes a duty on secular citizens to give up their\\nscientistically motivated atheism in favour of politically motivated\\nagnosticism (Lafont 2013: 238; Finlayson 2019: 14). The idea of\\n“sacred-to-secular translation” is central to\\nHabermas’s model of postsecular deliberative democracy. As an\\nexample, Habermas cites German Christian groups translating the\\nstatement from Genesis that “God created man in his own\\nimage” into secular language as “a gamete fertilized has the status of a subject of human rights”\\nas part of their arguments against stem-cell research (2001b chapter 2\\n[2003b: 109]). Yet the idea has proved controversial. It is not clear,\\nfor example, whether or not Habermas considers it to work the same way\\nas ethical and philosophical appropriations of religious concepts (see\\nCooke 2011; Kerkwijk 2015; Rees 2018: 143–65). For Wolterstorff\\nit relies on the idea of post-metaphysical reason that is skewed in\\nfavour of secularism, while Rees argues that the idea is empty, since\\nno such translations are possible.  \\nex utero'), Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Jürgen Habermas', 'Header 2': 'Bibliography'}, page_content='Bibliography'), Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Jürgen Habermas', 'Header 2': 'Bibliography', 'Header 3': 'Works by Habermas'}, page_content='Works by Habermas'), Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Jürgen Habermas', 'Header 2': 'Bibliography', 'Header 3': 'Works by Habermas'}, page_content='1962 [1989], , (Politica\\u202f; Abhandlungen und Texte zur\\npolitischen Wissenschaft 4), Neuwied, Berlin: Luchterhand.
